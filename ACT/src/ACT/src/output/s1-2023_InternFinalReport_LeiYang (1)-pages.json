description \nclassification project and identifying the areas where i can contribute and learn. to achieve \nthese goals, i participated in several activities:  \n  \nfirstly, i attended an it induction session to set up my technical working environment. this \nallowed me to understand the tools and infrastructure used in the project, and how to navigate \ndomain database using python connected with snowflakes.  \n  \ni also participated in an orientation session with the data team and human resources, which \nhelped me gain a better understanding of domain’s culture, value, and the allocation of the \ndata department. additionally, i participated in weekly team meetings with my supervisor and \nteam members, where i learned about ongoing projects and asked related questions. i found \nthe experience of receiving exceptional team support to be particularly rewarding during the \nfirst week. the supportive efforts of the team supervisor, teammate, it support, data engineer \nprovided detailed instructions and solutions to technical and project-related issues, which \nhelped me to quickly acclimate to my internship role and feel comfortable within the team.  \n  \none of the most difficult experiences i faced during the first week was learning new technical \nskills and adapting to a new work environment. however, i approached these difficulties with \na positive attitude and a willingness to ask and learn. i am grateful for the supportive \nenvironment that i am in, as it has made the learning process easier.  \n  \noverall, i gained a solid understanding of the project data infrastructure, as well as the tools \nusing for retrieving, processing, analyzing data and knowledge sharing. additionally, i got to \nknow my supervisor and team members, which has helped me feel more comfortable in my \nrole and allowed me to establish strong working relationships with my colleagues. i look \nforward to continuing to learn and contribute to the project in the coming weeks.  \n  \nweek 2  \nthis week was all about getting started with the description classification project. my focus \nwas on data exploration and cleaning, which was challenging but rewarding. i learned a lot \nabout the importance of accurate data labeling and how it can impact the outcome of the \nproject.  \n  \none of the most rewarding experiences of the week was collaborating with my supervisor and \ncolleagues. i had the opportunity to learn from their expertise and insights, and i also shared \nmy own ideas and findings. i realized that effective communication and collaboration are \ncrucial for the success of any project, and i will make sure to continue to engage with my \nteam in this way.   \n  \none of the most difficult aspects of the week was working with large amounts of text data. \nprocessing this type of data requires a lot of effort and attention to detail, and it can be \n \nchallenging to derive meaningful insights from unstructured data. however, i found this \nexperience to be valuable as it helped me to improve my problem-solving and analytical \nskills. i also gained knowledge and skills related to data cleaning, annotation, and filtering \nwith keywords.   \n  \noverall, i made good progress in week 2 and was excited to continue exploring the data and \nrefining our approach to the project. i was looking forward to the next phase of the project \nand to continuing to work closely with my team.  \n  \nweek 3  \none of the primary goals for the week was to participate in weekly team meetings and stay \ninformed about ongoing projects. i attended weekly team meetings with my supervisor and \ncolleagues to gain insights and learn about their work. during these meetings, i shared my \nprogress and asked for clarification on related topics. by participating in these meetings, i \ndeveloped a better understanding of the project objectives and use cases. i also learned how to \npresent my findings effectively and provide background information to first-time audiences.  \n  \nanother important activity for the week was to conduct thorough data exploration and \nannotation. i worked on updating and expanding the keyword extraction process with my \nsupervisor. we added new development properties to the keyword list and applied it to the \nrecords which had agreement on data labels from both data sources. however, during the \nprocess, i encountered a challenge in keyword extraction. initially, i did not use generalized \nrules for extracting keywords and ended up including a large number of overly specific and \nspecialized keywords in the keyword list. as a result, i spent more time cleaning and refining \nthe keyword list. but it was a valuable learning experience, and i gained a deeper \nunderstanding of the importance of using appropriate rules and criteria for selecting \nkeywords.  \n  \nthroughout the week, i also had the opportunity to develop my skills in pycharm, which is a \nmore powerful tool for programming use cases, particularly in a professional setting. i \nlearned how to use pycharm for data cleaning and preparation, which helped me to improve \nthe efficiency of the data cleaning process.   \n  \nin conclusion, this week was a valuable learning experience for me. i gained new knowledge \nand skills in keyword extraction, data cleaning, and presentation design. i also had the \nopportunity to collaborate with my supervisor and colleagues, which helped me to better \nunderstand the project objectives and use cases. despite the challenges that i encountered; i \nview them as valuable learning opportunities. i'm looking forward to applying my new \nknowledge and skills in the coming weeks and contributing to the project's success.  \n  \nweek 4  \nduring the fourth week of my internship, i continued to work on building an accurate training \ndataset for the project. this week was particularly rewarding because i was able to refine my \nunderstanding of the project goals and work collaboratively with my team to develop \neffective solutions.  \n  \none of rewarding experience was developing a comprehensive data cleaning and annotation \nplan for the existing dataset. this required analyzing the dataset's infrastructure and \n \ncollaborating with team members to implement the plan using best practices and efficient \nworkflows. through this process, i learned how to break down a complex problem into \nmanageable steps and work collaboratively with others to achieve a common goal. i also \nlearned how to effectively communicate my ideas and receive feedback from my team \nmembers.  \n  \none of the most challenging experiences of this week was experimenting with different \nalgorithms to predict labels for the dataset. this required a great deal of trial and error, and \nsometimes the results were unpredictable and led to no meaningful outcomes. however, i \nlearned to manage the experience results by summarization and list pros and cons of each \nalgorithm which proved to be a good way to record and report the work have been done and \ndocumentation to the future experiements.  \n  \nduring this week, i learned about the importance of keywords importance and how to \nestablish a comprehensive list that informed the development of the algorithms. i also gained \na deeper understanding of cosine similarities and zero-shot text classification. in terms of \nskills, i learned how to diagnose and fix library import problems and transitioned from using \njupyter notebook to pycharm, which helped streamline coding efficiency and productivity.  \n  \nlooking back on the past four weeks, i have come to appreciate the importance of asking \nquestions and seeking guidance from my supervisor and team members. i have also learned \nthat effective communication and collaboration are essential to achieving project goals. \nthrough my work on the project, i have gained new knowledge and skills that will be \nvaluable in my future work. i have also developed a deeper appreciation for the complexity \nand challenges of nlp and the importance of building a clean training dataset.  \n  \nin conclusion, the fourth week of my internship was a rewarding and challenging experience. \nthrough collaborating with my team members and participating in discussions, i gained a \ndeeper understanding of the project goals and developed effective solutions. i also gained \nnew knowledge and skills that will be valuable in my future work. while there were certainly \nchallenges along the way, i learned that persistence and effective communication are key to \nachieving success. i was excited to continue working on this project and to see how it \ndevelops in the weeks to come.  \n  \nweek 5  \nduring week 5, my primary goal was to continue building up the training dataset for our \nproject. to achieve this, i analyzed the existing dataset's infrastructure and worked with my \ncolleagues to develop a comprehensive data cleaning and annotation plan. this plan aimed to \nensure that our dataset was clean, accurate, and labeled consistently, which is crucial for \ntraining effective machine learning models.  \n  \none of the key activities i engaged in during the week was applying experiments on the \nopenai pretrained zero shot classification model. this helped me to compare its \nperformance with the other models we were working with. through these experiments, i \ngained a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each model and established \na baseline for easily checking and comparing labeling in the next steps.  \n  \n \nin addition to the experiments, i also compared the performance of three different models in \npredicting labels for data that did not contain refined keywords. this was an important task as \nit helped us develop solutions for prediction label conflicts, which could be problematic \nduring the training process. i categorized the data based on their original labels and prediction \nlabels and randomly checked the property description text based on prediction results.  \n   \noverall, i gained several new knowledge and skills during week 5. for example, i learned \nabout zero shot text classification and openai pretrained models. i also developed new skills \nin importing and applying openai pretrained models and developed solutions for prediction \nlabel conflicts. these experiences provided me with valuable insights into the field of nlp \nand increased my confidence in building effective ml models.  \n  \none of the rewarding experiences during the week was realizing the importance of reviewing \nand sharing my thoughts with professionals on the team. by doing so, i received feedback \nand insights that helped me to improve my work and develop better solutions. i also \nappreciated the ongoing support and guidance provided by my supervisor and team members, \nwhich enabled me to ask questions and seek help when needed.  \n  \nhowever, there were also challenging experiences during the week, such as randomly reading \nthrough many properties’ descriptions. this was time-consuming and mentally taxing, but it \nwas also beneficial as it helped me gain a deeper understanding of the industry, filter correct \nkeywords, and identify relevant information quickly.  \n  \nin conclusion, week 5 was an exciting and productive week, and i was pleased with the \nprogress made towards our project goals. i was also grateful for the opportunity to learn new \nknowledge and skills, work with a supportive team, and apply my skills to real-world \nproblems.  \n  \nweek 6  \nthis week, i continued to work on the data cleaning and annotation tasks for our project. \nspecifically, i focused on checking and dropping duplicate data to ensure the integrity of our \ntraining dataset. i also reran the code to verify that the changes i made did not affect the \nperformance of the models we were using.  \n  \nfinally, i finalized the training data and loaded it onto snowflake, our cloud data \nwarehousing platform. the process of checking and dropping duplicate data was \ntimeconsuming but necessary to avoid bias and overfitting in our models. i used python \npandas library to identify the duplicated rows based on their property descriptions and labels. \nafter examining the results, i decided to drop the duplicated rows and keep only the first \noccurrence of each unique description. this helped to reduce the size of our dataset and \nimprove the quality of the remaining data.  \n  \nonce i finished the data cleaning and annotation tasks, i reran the code to verify that the \nchanges did not affect the performance of the models we were using. i also used pycharm to \nstreamline the coding process and improve my productivity. finally, my supervisor loaded the \nfinalized training data onto snowflake.  \n  \n \nin conclusion, this week's efforts had brought us one step closer to achieving our project \ngoals. i was looking forward to seeing how the finalized training data would perform in the \nnext phase of the project and to continue learning and growing through this experience. \n \nweek 7 \nduring the seventh week of my internship at domain group, my primary goals involved \nactive participation in team meetings and discussions and initiating the analysis of training \ndata for modelling experiments. to align my work with project goals, i maintained regular \ncommunication with my supervisor and participated in team meetings for updates and \nclarifications. \ni conducted feature engineering using bags of words (like tf-idf) and trained data using a \nnaïve bayesian model. this hands-on experience contributed significantly to my \nunderstanding of property description data and honed my skills in nlp model building and \nanalysis. \nthe process of understanding and selecting features for the models was challenging, as it \nrequired a deep understanding of the data and careful attention to ensure no valuable \ninformation was overlooked. \none of the most rewarding aspects of this week was the opportunity to discuss ideas with \nexperienced team members. their feedback and insights greatly helped improve my work and \ndevise more effective solutions. \nthese experiences, both challenging and rewarding, were instrumental in my professional \ngrowth. the skills and knowledge i acquired this week have laid a solid foundation for my \nfuture career in data science. as i progress in my internship, i intend to apply these learnings \nto enhance my approach to feature selection and model building. \n \nweek 8  \nin the eighth week of my data internship at domain group, my objectives centered around \nevaluating models based on a cleaned training dataset using various feature engineering \ntechniques and models. these included naive bayes, logistic regression, random forest, \nword2vec, and distilbert. as usual, an integral part of my activities involved active \nparticipation in team meetings and discussions. \ni completed model training based on the training dataset, utilizing different models and \nfeature engineering techniques. the outcomes were compared and visualized, fostering a deep \nunderstanding of the impact of different techniques and models on performance. \nsimultaneously, i further developed my skills in nlp model building and analysis, \nimplementing regularization and early stopping techniques to prevent overfitting. \nthe gained knowledge extended to strategies for model evaluation using different techniques \nand preventing overfitting. skills development centered around evaluating and comparing \nmodels and understanding feature engineering based on different strategies. this week's \nexperience offered a substantial opportunity to evaluate models based on over 100,000 new \ndata points and work with large, computationally demanding models. \ntwo experiences stood out as particularly rewarding this week: achieving a high f1 score of \n98% on the logistic regression model with tf-idf vectorization and feature engineering, \nand collaborating with colleagues to receive feedback that helped refine my work. \nhowever, a significant challenge arose in training the distilbert model, primarily due to the \nspecific data size and the time required to fit the model. this difficulty emphasized the \nimportance of efficient computation management when dealing with large datasets and \n \ncomplex models. these insights and experiences will undoubtedly contribute to my ongoing \nlearning and professional growth in the data science field. \n \nweek 9  \nduring the ninth week of my internship at domain group, my goals remained focused on \nevaluating models using various feature engineering techniques such as naive bayes, \nlogistic regression, random forest, word2vec, and distilbert. actively participating in \nteam meetings and discussions continued to provide valuable insights and collaborative \nopportunities. \ni evaluated different models on a cleaned training dataset and compared and visualized the \nresults. this process allowed me to gain an in-depth understanding of how these techniques \nand models impact model performance. consequently, my skills in nlp model building, \nanalysis, and regularization techniques to prevent overfitting were further improved. \none crucial knowledge point was understanding how to use cross validation in model \nevaluation. my skills in comparing models using various feature engineering techniques were \nenhanced, and the experience of model evaluation and selection proved enlightening. \na rewarding experience was evaluating models on different new datasets. it became clear \nhow high-quality data can improve model performance significantly. however, some \ndifficulties emerged, particularly regarding the accuracy of evaluation data labels. to address \nthis, i applied a data cleaning pipeline to improve the data and performed a false positive \nanalysis to find ways to enhance the model and rectify any label correctness issues. \ndespite these challenges, my experiences during this week offered valuable lessons in data \nmanagement, model evaluation, and teamwork, providing instrumental skills that will be \nbeneficial in my future career in data science. \n \nweek 10  \nduring the tenth week of my data internship at domain group, my primary goals were to \nevaluate a new dataset comprising over 100,000 instances, ensure the correctness of original \ndata labels, fit the finalized data to a logistic regression model, and work on a docker \ncontainer for deployment. the overarching aim was to achieve an overall f1 score of 0.98. \nto meet these goals, i started by evaluating the new dataset and performed a label correctness \ncheck. to address any label correctness issues, a data cleaning pipeline was applied. \nfollowing this, the finalized dataset was fitted to a logistic regression model. a significant \npart of my activities was participation in team meetings and discussions, where i presented \nthe project's progress. \nthe outcomes of these activities were successful: the new dataset was evaluated, label \ncorrectness ensured, and an impressive f1 score of 0.98 was achieved with the logistic \nregression model. progress on the docker container for deployment was also notable. \nin terms of new knowledge and skills, i became familiar with docker containerization for \ndeployment and improved my ability to check label correctness and fit data to a logistic \nregression model. presenting project progress in team meetings was an enriching experience \nthat enhanced my team communication and presentation skills. \nthe most rewarding experiences included practicing new technologies like docker \ncontainerization, seeing the impact of high-quality data on model performance, and \nparticipating in team communication and presentations. however, the week was not without \nits challenges. ensuring the correctness of over 2,000 false positive labels and improving the \nmodel's performance was a considerable task, as was applying a data cleaning pipeline to \naddress label correctness problems. despite these difficulties, the week's experiences \n \nprovided valuable lessons and practical experience that will be beneficial in my future data \nscience career. \n \nweek 11  \nduring the eleventh week of my internship, my objectives were primarily focused on the \ndeployment process of our best-performing model. the goals included setting up a local \nvirtual environment following the git repository's docker format and utilizing a makefile. i \naimed to use linting tools to ensure code correctness and adherence to best practices. i also \nplanned to successfully run the application locally using app.run and create a docker image \nfor pushing it to github, subsequently triggering the ci/cd process. \nto achieve these goals, i set up a local virtual environment using docker and makefile as \nspecified in the git repository. i utilized linting tools for code correctness and maintaining \nbest practices. after verifying the application's functionality by running it locally with \napp.run, i created a docker image and pushed it to github. this move initiated the ci/cd \nprocess, which was a crucial learning point for me. \nthe week was successful as i managed to initiate the deployment process for the top-\nperforming model and set up a local virtual environment. i ensured code correctness through \nlinting, verified the application's functionality by running it locally, and finally, triggered the \nci/cd process by pushing a docker image to github. \nthis week was particularly enriching in terms of knowledge, skills, and experience. i learned \nabout docker formats for setting up a virtual environment, the utility of makefile for \nenvironment setup, docker image creation, and the ci/cd process. the skills i improved on \nincluded setting up a local virtual environment, using linting tools, running applications \nlocally, and creating docker images. \nrewarding experiences included collaborating with my team to tackle license and technical \nproblems, setting up the local virtual environment, and initiating the ci/cd process. learning \nnew deployment concepts and technologies contributed greatly to my professional growth. \non the other hand, understanding these new deployment concepts and implementing them \nwere challenging, requiring a considerable effort to overcome. however, these difficulties \nhave served as steppingstones for my learning journey, preparing me for similar challenges in \nthe future. \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n",
