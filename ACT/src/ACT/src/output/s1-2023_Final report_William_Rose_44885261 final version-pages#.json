    "text": "week 6\nthis was my first week of the internship.\ni entered a call with saleh and amin to discuss my internship placement. i made up my mind\nthat i would begin and enter the building on 31.03.2023.\ni began my first day by dressing well and being cleanly shaven. first impressions count! i\nwalked into the building and used the elevator to go to level 3. i then called amin through the\nin-house telephone. he granted me access and then introduced me to saleh. amin then left\nsaleh and i alone. saleh then told me to “pick a desk”. i picked the one directly behind his. i was\nthen greeted by my co-workers. these were hassan and mahdieh. they welcomed me to the\noffice and let me get to work. i then cleaned my desk with mahdieh assisting me and then set up\nmy workstation (laptop, mouse etc). i then began working on the tasks i was assigned.\nlater in the day, saleh gave me a pear to eat. i met nasrin, alireza and maryam.\nwhile i worked i mostly listened to music and drank coffee. at lunchtime, i went to the campus\nhub to eat. after lunch, i continued working until i joined the team in a meeting. a guest lecturer\ncame and presented ideas on how we can use generative ai to assist recommender systems.\nbefore i left i was required to set up my id tag to gain access to the building. i went down to\nlevel 2 and spoke to the staff there and informed them of what i required. they said they would\nbe in contact with amin and that my id should allow me to enter the level 3 building in 24h.\ni asked saleh what would this job entail. he said we will mostly be looking at how generative ai\ncan be used to aid businesses in their processes.\ni completed half the tasks assigned to me this week and informed saleh i would finish the tasks\non monday the following week.\nmy first impression was that the floor was a normal office and saleh and amin seemed like nice\npolite individuals. the same could be said for the rest of my co-workers.\nby working through the tasks assigned to me by saleh i learned about the different aspects of\ngenerative ai. an example was code generation in different languages and the fact that\ngenerative ai chatbots such as chatgpt use the deep learning ai model.\n23\nit was nice to feel so welcomed at this new workplace. it was a surprise to me as generally\nspeaking, this has not happened at other places i have worked. i enjoyed working with ai. it was\nnice getting lunch on campus.\ni liked that i was included in a meeting on my first day. although i was still new this made me\nfeel welcomed and showed me that the team wanted me to feel included.\nhaving my own desk was significant as it meant i had a space i could feel comfortable and\nproductive.\ni hypothesised that the centre would be clean, organized and productive. my reasoning for this\nwas previous exposure to the centre (from an event at ibm - sydney) and previous exposure to\nthe school of computing at 9 wallys walk (previously known as e6a). my hypothesis was\nproven correct based on my experience during this first week.\nadditionally, i hypothesized that i would enjoy working at the centre. this again was proven\ncorrect. for a long time, i have wanted to contribute to science and humanity’s understanding of\nour universe. by researching and contributing to the field of generative ai, i am able to do this!\nthis was again confirmed by my experience during my first week at aai@mq.\nanother comment id like to make about the work is that it is almost science fiction! working with\nchatgpt, elevenlabs and dall-e does not seem real. it is like i am working with a person\nliving inside my screen. science fiction is the phrase i have been using to describe to friends\nand family what it is like working with this technology. as a technology enthusiast, it is like i am\ndreaming. how can this be real?\nas to what this all means? i believe that i will have a fun and enjoyable time at the centre during\nmy internship.\nthis week i wanted to answer the questions “will i enjoy my time and will this internship benefit\nme in my career?” i can honestly answer yes to both questions.\nthe office is not far from home. the office has a cafe. the staff are friendly. the work is\nenjoyable. i have a good relationship with my superiors. i am genuinely happy about going to\nwork. overall based on the experienced described above i am very happy at aai@mq.\nwill this internship benefit my career? to answer that question we need to discuss what are my\ncareer aspirations. i plan to have a job that simply uses technology to aid businesses by\nimproving efficiency. this is similar to what saleh said we would be doing. i am able to do this\nwith 2 supervisors aiding me (saleh and amin). the internship lets me do what i want to do in\nmy career.\nthis week i learned quite a lot and i believe this will help me in my career. the most important\nthing i learned relating to this is what exactly is generative ai. as i mentioned in this document\n24\nbefore, my social media is flooded with information about ai. i hear all these fancy words but\nnever looked up the proper definitions. this week i was able to do that and consult with\nacademics about this. by filtering out the noise and defining and truly understanding this\ntechnology i believe that i can use this technology to help businesses in the future. additionally,\nlearning about office etiquette is beneficial as i have never really worked in an office like this one\nbefore. this is a soft skill that i believe will go a long way.\ni believe that this week i was motivated and worked hard. i was able to set out a plan for the\nweek and execute it. my coursework always taught me to question things, collaborate with\nothers and to be honest, i believe i was able to do that this week and would like to continue\ndoing this for the rest of the internship.\n9.2) week 7\nthis is my second week in the office. i began by using my id to enter the building. i then worked\non the tasks set to me by saleh last week. i wanted to finish the tasks so that i could begin new\ntasks and properly use generative ai tools. i came into the office 3 days this week. monday,\ntuesday and wednesday. i knew that amin wanted me to come in 3 days a week. i planned to\nwork at world vision on thursday this week.\non monday i worked and finished the tasks set out by saleh. we then reviewed the work i\nproduced and i was assigned new tasks.\non tuesday i brought my brother and girlfriend to see what i was working on. the first thing we\nnoticed was how polite and welcoming everyone was. saleh also showed me that he had put a\nnametag on my desk, which i appreciated. after showing the guests around i escorted them out\nof the building. i then began working on the tasks saleh had set out for me. by the end of\nwednesday, i had finished the tasks. additionally, i spoke with saleh about future research work\nand the use of trello to manage our work.\nsaleh, having sensed i had finished the tasks he assigned to me, decided to give me more\nwork. this stressed me out a little as i had a busy week ahead and only a few hours to complete\nthe new tasks. thankfully though i was able to conduct research and complete the tasks\nproperly. these tasks were related to “recommender systems”.\ni am glad that my id worked. i want to come and go as i please and not need to bother anyone.\nthis week i was able to really make use of generative ai tools such as dall-e, chatgpt and\nelevenlabs. i learned that chatgpt is extremely powerful. i was able to generate html code to\nmake a fan website for my favourite band slipknot. additionally, i was able to create the\nflappybird game by asking chatgpt to write code for a basic implementation of the game in\nthe language named processing (similar to java).\n25\none of the tasks saleh asked me to do was to research and learn about google colab. this is a\npython-based online compiler environment. essentially, i can write and execute python code in\nthis environment without downloading any ides or even installing python locally. i believe that\nthis is a powerful tool and hypothesized that i could use chatgpt to write python code to call\nupon its api to answer a question much like how anyone can use chatgpt on the open ai\nwebsite. thankfully, i was able to do this. the only manual procedure involved was to provide\nmy own api key.\ni wanted to do this as i understand the power that apis provide developers. i wanted to use the\npower of chatgpt in my own applications if i so choose. this may include having a discord bot!\nthese three accomplishments i would present next week to the centre.\nas i mentioned above i was required to complete tasks related to recommender systems. i was\nstressed about this due to a lack of time. thankfully however because i had learned about them\nduring the previous week’s meeting and because i was able to conduct research i was able to\nanswer the questions.\ni am beginning to feel stressed over this report and the midterm presentation. i need to inform\nsaleh that i have a lengthy report due soon and might need to do less research work in order to\nproduce a high-quality report on time.\nthe first topic id like to evaluate is saleh’s response to me completing my tasks. as soon as he\nknew i was finished he gave me additional tasks to complete. this is good. what this means is\nthat i will always have work to do. i do feel comfortable however to tell saleh if i have too much\nwork.\nthis week i was able to harness the power of generative ai, properly for the first time. this\nallowed me to generate meaningful material and has opened the door for future use. a moment\ni found significant was using the api call in google colab. it was like when i wrote my first hello\nworld program. i felt powerful like i had the ability to call upon a digital aid. this allows me to\nuse api calls in my own code. an example of this could be in spreadsheets, discord, or other\nprograms i make or use. i come from a game design background so i often think about being\nable to ask an npc a question with it using generative ai to produce a response. this could be\nmulti-model too.\nthis week i was really able to get into the meat and potatoes of my work. i enjoyed my work and\ncollaborated with saleh. we discussed the work i had done and he gave me useful tips for\nimprovement. additionally, we discussed future work and how i may help him on using\ngenerative ai for pretty significant projects.\noverall, i had a pretty good week. this weekend is easter and i look forward to spending time\nwith family over this period. additionally, i like that saleh was able to set aside some time in his\nday to review my work. this shows me he cares.\n26\ni plan to use this technology going forward. the ability to call upon the chatgpt api will aid\nsaleh and i in future projects. this week i gained more practical experience with generative ai\ntools. this is valuable as i can really see the potential these tools have. aside from work, even\nin my everyday life, i have started to use generative ai for personal reasons. i am so excited to\nuse these tools! i often find myself using the tools at home just for fun with family members. i\nplan over the easter break to show my extended family the power of chatgpt. it will make for\nquite an interesting conversation at the dinner table.\n9.3) week 7.1\nduring this time period i had to inform saleh that i had to spend most of my working time writing\nthis report. i did continue to do independent research and use generative ai tools.\ni attended one meeting in week 7.1. this gave me the opportunity to present to the centre some\nof my work with generative ai (api implementation into python with google colab and a flappy\nbird game implementation in the processing language). the meeting was enjoyable. my\ncolleague mahdieh labani presented some ideas around autogpt which i later researched in\nmy own time. additionally, amin presented some ideas surrounding how we should be going\nabout our research and how to stay up to date. importantly he stressed the importance of\nmental health.\nunfortunately on\nsaturday 15.04.2023, my mother’s cousin passed away. this turned my life\nupside down for a little and amin decided to give me the week off. thank you again amin for\ndoing this for me and my family.\n9.4) week 7.2\nthe only day i spent in the office this week (7.2) was tuesday. saleh mentioned that he was\ngoing to the gym during work hours. i mentioned that this would be good for his mental health\nand have positive effects on his work. he mentioned that amin encourages him to be physically\nactive as this aids his mental health and research capabilities.\nthe only other day i worked this week was friday (from home) so i could be there for my family\nand be productive with this internship.\n9.5) week 8\nthis week was difficult. i worked on wednesday, thursday and friday. the funeral was on\nmonday and tuesday was a public holiday. for the most part, all i did this week was work on\n27\nthis report and the presentation. in my own time (outside office hours) i continued to research\ndifferent aspects of generative ai.\non wednesday i returned to the office. i set up my computer and spoke to saleh. he had given\nme feedback on previous work. the feedback was positive and he encouraged me to now work\non this report and upcoming presentation. he even included some tips for the presentation.\nunfortunately, i felt sick on this day and left the office early.\non wednesday i sent amin and saleh an email outlining when i would be submitting\ndocumentation to the university. additionally, i planned how i would present my findings to amin.\nwe concluded on thursday via email that i would present to him in his office.\ni really like the open communication channels here at the centre. it shows respect and makes\nme happy knowing that i am valued.\non thursday i kept working on the midterm report and finished most of it.\ncome friday i reviewed, edited and kept working on the midterm report. additionally, on friday\namin hosted a brief meeting at 10 am then we celebrated saleh’s birthday with coffee and cake.\nthis is nice as it shows saleh that he is a valued team member and it let me meet new people\nand socialize.\nfinally, on saturday i finished polishing the report and submitted the document to the university.\n9.6) week 9\nafter completing the midterm report on saturday i wanted to take a small break from work and\ncontinued working from home on tuesday. on tuesday i worked on the mid-term presentation.\nmore notably on monday, i discovered a world of warcraft addon named voiceover. this addon\nuses the elevenlabs ai tool to generate voices for npcs in-game. i decided i wanted to present\nthis to the group on friday (05.05.2023). i spoke with saleh about this and showcased how the\naddon works in-game. he was impressed and agreed it was an impressive use of generative ai.\ni emailed amin and got approval to present this instead of presenting anti-plagiarism tools. more\ndetails about this addon can be viewed in an article on the wowhead website (archimtiros,\n2023).\nadditionally, on wednesday i finished working on my midterm presentation. included in the\npresentation is an ai-generated video. this involved using elevenlabs to create an ai voice\nfollowed by using d-id to create a video to present to the audience. note that the video\npresents only a fraction of the overall presentation however, i thought it was a cool thing to add.\n28\nthursday came around. i presented my work (midterm presentation) to amin, taziva and saleh.\ni believe it went well. additionally, i received my marks for the midterm report and presentation\nand got 85% and 90% respectively. i am happy with these results. on this day i also presented\na draft version of my voiceover addon presentation to saleh and asked for feedback.\nwhen friday came around i was keen and excited to begin my presentation on the voiceover\naddon. the 10 am meeting occurred and we discussed various topics about ai. i gave my\npresentation however i had to do it very quickly as we did not have much time. i felt a little\nnervous talking about ai in front of a neurosurgeon (guest). additionally, on friday, saleh\nintroduced me to the overleaf application. this tool allows me to streamline document\nproduction with its built in tools. this tool will be crucial to the production of my whitepaper.\n9.7) week 10\nweek 10 came around and i planned to work on monday, tuesday and friday. i continued to\nuse the overleaf application and worked on tasks saleh planned for me. this included looking\nat the different templates that overleaf has available as well as categorizing and explaining\nsome of the different generative ai tools available online.\nwhen tuesday came around i continued working on my whitepaper. i learned quite a lot on\nmonday. i managed to use a tool that automates referencing for bibtex. this really helps as i\nwould struggle to code the references myself. overall i think the overleaf tool is quite useful and\nwill help me produce high-quality documents. additionally, it will assist me in collaborating with\nsaleh and amin.\non tuesday i also discussed with masoud various tools relating to plagiarism. i instigated this\nconversation as i wanted to discuss various tools that students use to get around plagiarism\ndetection tools such as turnitin and grammarly plagiarism checker. on this day i felt quite\nsluggish but i was able to get a decent amount of work done.\non friday i attended a team meeting with various members of the team discussing different\naspects of their work and or interesting topics they stumbled upon throughout the week. i\ncontinued to work on my whitepaper and even expressed interest to amin to run the discord\nserver for aai@mq. in the afternoon i spoke to saleh about my work on the whitepaper. he\ncritiqued my work and i plan to review the work on monday. overall, today was a good day.\n29\n9.8) week 11\nunfortunately, i woke up on monday feeling quite ill. i decided it was best that i work from home\non monday and tuesday and come into the office on friday. on monday i continued to work on\nthe whitepaper, taking into consideration the criticism that saleh gave me. i managed to mostly\nfix an issue we were having regarding image placement and added more detail throughout the\ndocument. i later sent saleh a linkedin message updating him on my progress. today i\ncontinued to research various aspects of generative ai. i have come to the conclusion that i\nwould like to be an ai consultant once i finish this internship. i believe this internship is providing\nme with the skills and knowledge necessary to achieve this goal. i would like to have a meeting\nwith amin and saleh regarding my future so we can plan what to do next.\non tuesday i continued to work on the whitepaper by researching different generative ai tools. i\nincluded, chatgpt, mentioned google bard, and github’s copilot. i have organised a meeting\nbetween saleh, amin and i for next friday morning. we will be discussing my future plans as an\nai consultant.\non friday i went into the office. i had a brief meeting with amin regarding my career and asked\nfor some advice. he mentioned to me that i should apply for ba roles if i want to be an ai\nconsultant in the future. additionally, we spoke about internal deadlines for submissions i need\nto make to the university (presentation and final report). after our brief meeting, we then joined\nthe rest of the team for a meeting. during our time together we discussed various applications of\ngenerative ai and i was asked to present. i briefly spoke about google’s bard as a competitor to\nchatgpt and the new tool launched by nvidea that uses ai to keep your eyes looking into a\ncamera. when the meeting finished, i took a break to get some lunch then informed saleh about\nwhat amin and i discussed during our (private) meeting. saleh recommended some sources for\nme to look at and gave his brief take on what i should do.\n9.9) week 12\nthis week i have a presentation due on thursday. i went into the office on tuesday and\nimmediately began working on this task. i wrote a draft script and prepared a presentation with\ngoogle slides. i practiced presenting and the timing was almost perfect. i have been allocated 5\nminutes and when practising i went for 5:15. i believe that with practice i can get the time down\nwhile not rushing. additionally, i learned about a tool named jukebox by openai. i spent a little\nbit of time researching this and plan to expand upon my findings in the whitepaper.\non wednesday i continued to work on my presentation. after some light edits and rehearsal, i\nasked saleh if i could practice my presentation with him. he agreed and we moved to the quiet\nroom next door to amin’s office. i practiced and he gave me some really good feedback that i\nlater used to change my presentation. as i write this i am now ready to present. for

            "goal": "week 6\nthis was my first week of the internship.\ni entered a call with saleh and amin to discuss my internship placement. i made up my mind\nthat i would begin and enter the building on 31.03.2023.\ni began my first day by dressing well and being cleanly shaven. first impressions count! i\nwalked into the building and used the elevator to go to level 3. i then called amin through the\nin-house telephone. he granted me access and then introduced me to saleh. amin then left\nsaleh and i alone. saleh then told me to “pick a desk”. i picked the one directly behind his. i was\nthen greeted by my co-workers. these were hassan and mahdieh. they welcomed me to the\noffice and let me get to work. i then cleaned my desk with mahdieh assisting me and then set up\nmy workstation (laptop, mouse etc). i then began working on the tasks i was assigned.\nlater in the day, saleh gave me a pear to eat. i met nasrin, alireza and maryam.\nwhile i worked i mostly listened to music and drank coffee. at lunchtime, i went to the campus\nhub to eat. after lunch, i continued working until i joined the team in a meeting. a guest lecturer\ncame and presented ideas on how we can use generative ai to assist recommender systems.\nbefore i left i was required to set up my id tag to gain access to the building. i went down to\nlevel 2 and spoke to the staff there and informed them of what i required. they said they would\nbe in contact with amin and that my id should allow me to enter the level 3 building in 24h.\ni asked saleh what would this job entail. he said we will mostly be looking at how generative ai\ncan be used to aid businesses in their processes.\ni completed half the tasks assigned to me this week and informed saleh i would finish the tasks\non monday the following week.\nmy first impression was that the floor was a normal office and saleh and amin seemed like nice\npolite individuals. the same could be said for the rest of my co-workers.\nby working through the tasks assigned to me by saleh i learned about the different aspects of\ngenerative ai. an example was code generation in different languages and the fact that\ngenerative ai chatbots such as chatgpt use the deep learning ai model.\n23\nit was nice to feel so welcomed at this new workplace. it was a surprise to me as generally\nspeaking, this has not happened at other places i have worked. i enjoyed working with ai. it was\nnice getting lunch on campus.\ni liked that i was included in a meeting on my first day. although i was still new this made me\nfeel welcomed and showed me that the team wanted me to feel included.\nhaving my own desk was significant as it meant i had a space i could feel comfortable and\nproductive.\ni hypothesised that the centre would be clean, organized and productive. my reasoning for this\nwas previous exposure to the centre (from an event at ibm - sydney) and previous exposure to\nthe school of computing at 9 wallys walk (previously known as e6a). my hypothesis was\nproven correct based on my experience during this first week.\nadditionally, i hypothesized that i would enjoy working at the centre. this again was proven\ncorrect. for a long time, i have wanted to contribute to science and humanity’s understanding of\nour universe. by researching and contributing to the field of generative ai, i am able to do this!\nthis was again confirmed by my experience during my first week at aai@mq.\nanother comment id like to make about the work is that it is almost science fiction! working with\nchatgpt, elevenlabs and dall-e does not seem real. it is like i am working with a person\nliving inside my screen. science fiction is the phrase i have been using to describe to friends\nand family what it is like working with this technology. as a technology enthusiast, it is like i am\ndreaming. how can this be real?\nas to what this all means? i believe that i will have a fun and enjoyable time at the centre during\nmy internship.\nthis week i wanted to answer the questions “will i enjoy my time and will this internship benefit\nme in my career?” i can honestly answer yes to both questions.\nthe office is not far from home. the office has a cafe. the staff are friendly. the work is\nenjoyable. i have a good relationship with my superiors. i am genuinely happy about going to\nwork. overall based on the experienced described above i am very happy at aai@mq.\nwill this internship benefit my career? to answer that question we need to discuss what are my\ncareer aspirations. i plan to have a job that simply uses technology to aid businesses by\nimproving efficiency. this is similar to what saleh said we would be doing. i am able to do this\nwith 2 supervisors aiding me (saleh and amin). the internship lets me do what i want to do in\nmy career.\nthis week i learned quite a lot and i believe this will help me in my career. the most important\nthing i learned relating to this is what exactly is generative ai. as i mentioned in this document\n24\nbefore, my social media is flooded with information about ai. i hear all these fancy words but\nnever looked up the proper definitions. this week i was able to do that and consult with\nacademics about this. by filtering out the noise and defining and truly understanding this\ntechnology i believe that i can use this technology to help businesses in the future. additionally,\nlearning about office etiquette is beneficial as i have never really worked in an office like this one\nbefore. this is a soft skill that i believe will go a long way.\ni believe that this week i was motivated and worked hard. i was able to set out a plan for the\nweek and execute it. my coursework always taught me to question things, collaborate with\nothers and to be honest, i believe i was able to do that this week and would like to continue\ndoing this for the rest of the internship.\n9.2)",

saleh’s response to me completing my tasks. as soon as he\nknew i was finished he gave me additional tasks to complete. this is good. what this means is\nthat i will always have work to do. i do feel comfortable however to tell saleh if i have too much\nwork.\nthis week i was able to harness the power of generative ai, properly for the first time. this\nallowed me to generate meaningful material and has opened the door for future use. a moment\ni found significant was using the api call in google colab. it was like when i wrote my first hello\nworld program. i felt powerful like i had the ability to call upon a digital aid. this allows me to\nuse api calls in my own code. an example of this could be in spreadsheets, discord, or other\nprograms i make or use. i come from a game design background so i often think about being\nable to ask an npc a question with it using generative ai to produce a response. this could be\nmulti-model too.\nthis week i was really able to get into the meat and potatoes of my work. i enjoyed my work and\ncollaborated with saleh. we discussed the work i had done and he gave me useful tips for\nimprovement. additionally, we discussed future work and how i may help him on using\ngenerative ai for pretty significant projects.\noverall, i had a pretty good week. this weekend is easter and i look forward to spending time\nwith family over this period. additionally, i like that saleh was able to set aside some time in his\nday to review my work. this shows me he cares.\n26\ni plan to use this technology going forward. the ability to call upon the chatgpt api will aid\nsaleh and i in future projects. this week i gained more practical experience with generative ai\ntools. this is valuable as i can really see the potential these tools have. aside from work, even\nin my everyday life, i have started to use generative ai for personal reasons. i am so excited to\nuse these tools! i often find myself using the tools at home just for
