my main goal was to refine the model by \nincorporating statistical steps. to achieve this, i engaged in activities such as verifying the \nmodel's performance with known fraud samples and making necessary adjustments to \nthe model. the outcome of my efforts was the development of a 5-step process to eliminate \noutliers, specifically focusing on brightness, sharpness, contrast, dynamic range, and noise \nin the images. additionally, i defined a cer (classification error rate) to handle \nmisclassification. \ninterpret: through these activities, i gained new knowledge and insights. i learned how \nto generate cer, far (false acceptance rate), and frr (false rejection rate) for each \nthreshold programmatically by myself, which provided valuable metrics to evaluate the \nperformance of the model. i also developed a python code to identify outliers in the raw \nimage dataset, which enhanced my coding skills. \none significant experience i had during this period was dealing with raw images of driver's \nlicenses that had hologram or washed-out image portions in our area of interest. i realized \nthat using these images directly in the model would increase the risk of misclassification. \nthis experience deepened my understanding of building a security system and the \nimportance of inference steps, where decisions are not solely based on a threshold but \nalso involve catching misclassified documents and reasoning about them after removing \noutliers. \nevaluate: based on my observations, i believe the steps i implemented to curate the \nimages and identify an acceptable range for the images used in model retraining were \neffective. by eliminating outliers, the model's performance improved, reducing the \nchances of misclassification. however, i also recognize the need for further evaluation and \nrefinement of the model to ensure its efficiency and accuracy. \nplan:  this learning experience has provided me with valuable knowledge and skills that \ni can apply in my future work. i plan to recommend the use of the developed 5-step \nprocess for eliminating outliers in image datasets to enhance the performance of machine \nlearning models. additionally, i will continue to explore and refine the model by \nincorporating additional steps and techniques to improve its efficiency and accuracy. \n \nin summary, this week's goals,
