    "text": "week 7 \nthis week's assignment was to provide apac region initials a to g country id authentication, information extraction \ntemplate creation, and support documentation. i also participated in the ai-enabled security tech summit and \nhackathon event and submitted my midterm internship report this week. my work output this week included \ncompleting the apac region a to g country identification documents, creating information extraction templates, and \nsupporting documentation, placing first in the project and third in the event, and submitting my midterm internship \nreport. \nthe most important experience for me this week was attending and placing well in the hackathon event co-organized \nby ibm and macquarie university. on the first day of the event, many of the industry's top practitioners gave inspiring \ntalks. these presentations deepened my understanding of artificial intelligence and cyber security. my group chose ai and \ncybersecurity on the second day of the event and designed an app to help schools monitor student cyberbullying. using \nthe machine learning and big data techniques i learned in school, i worked with another group member to design the \napplication's ai logic from data acquisition to data analysis. during this activity, i learned the importance of teamwork \nand that we could not have won first place in the project without the contributions of several other team members. \nsecondly, i also realized i still needed to improve my data science knowledge while designing the ai logic of the \napplication. therefore, i will continue to focus on learning this area in my future work and studies to improve my \nknowledge of artificial intelligence. although i attended the hackathon event this week, i still completed the tasks i \nposted in the monday meeting with high quality. this also proves that my time management skills are growing. \ninternship final report \ncomp8851/8860 industry based internship \n9th september 2022 \n \n11 \nfinally, due to school and company policy, we have two weeks off next. therefore, i will use these two weeks to review my \nprevious work and work on the tasks assigned by the school. \nweek 8 \nthis week's task was to provide the authentication and information extraction of identity documents for countries in the \napac region. the problem i encountered with this task was extracting text information from non-english identity \ndocuments. when i was working on the chinese identity documents, i was worried that the text data would not be \nextracted during the initial setup of the parameters because it was written in full chinese. fortunately, the text extraction \nmethod can support extracting chinese text information. i reported this finding in the debriefing session this week. \nin addition, i believe that a well-timed break can effectively improve productivity. my productivity dropped somewhat in \nthe week before i started the break. i could not devote myself to work and study due to the pressure of work and study. so, \nafter two weeks of rest, i was excited when i started working again. this state helped me complete the tasks i had set for \nthis week and did the extra work of authenticating all the finnish identity documents and extracting information. \nfinally, in the next week, i hope to continue in this state and keep up my current work output. \nweek 9 \nthis week, the company asked us to authenticate and get information from identity documents from countries with the \nletters a through g on all continents. although this monday was a public holiday, it did not affect my productivity this \nweek. my working output for the week was the authentication of three country identity documents, the extraction of five \nidentity documents, and five supporting documents. \nduring the regular work session this week, our group discussed the document processing problems encountered in the \ninformation extraction phase of the dataset. this problem affected our efficiency in extracting information from the files. \nthe supervisor told us that the solution was first to check the parameters' accuracy of the training data and then to \nconfirm the testing data for any parameter problems. if neither of these checks found any issues, we needed to change the \nexisting testing data or collect testing data again. this problem has happened to me in the past. however, my solution is to \nignore the complex testing data and collect some new testing data instead of changing the parameters of the testing data. \nmy previous work was flawed on this issue because i thought that changing the parameters of the testing data would take \nme a long time rather than collecting new testing data, which would reduce my productivity. this mistake will make the \ndata extraction model less accurate for the rest of the test data, so i will try to avoid it and look back at the problems in my \nprevious work in the next few weeks. \nnext week, i'll review all my past work to ensure it won't be wrong when the product is ready to use. \nweek 10 \nthe main task this week was to check all the previously completed tasks. also, i will continue to authenticate and extract \ninformation from the identity documents of all countries from continents a to g.  \nthe outputs of this week are as follows: firstly, i checked all the previously completed tasks and adjusted some template \nparameters to enhance the accuracy of information extraction. secondly, i met two templates for information extraction \nand two supporting documents. \none of the most important experiences for me this week was to do a thorough check of the previously completed tasks. \nfirst, this check helps me ensure the final work product is completed. secondly, reviewing and checking my work period \nwill improve my productivity. if there are a lot of problems with defective products in the future, it will take more time to \ncheck all the data again than to check periodically, which will reduce productivity. fortunately, my current work output \nhas not accumulated to the point of being impossible to detect, so i was able to complete the inspection of all my work in \njust two days. also, i think it would be better to check the work once a month so that it will not affect the efficiency of \nwork and ensure the completion of products. i will make it a habit to check my work regularly and apply it in the future. \nnext week, i will continue to authenticate and extract information from all countries with initials a to g from all \ncontinents. \ninternship final report \ncomp8851/8860 industry based internship \n9th september 2022 \n \n12 \nweek  11 \nthe task for this week was to keep working on authenticating and extracting information from identity documents for all \neuropean countries. the outcome of this week was to provide the supporting documents and information extraction \ntemplates for all the identity documents of four european countries. \nthis week, i felt a certain amount of pressure as it was nearing the end of the semester, and all my other course \nassignments were nearing submission. i thought i would be able to manage my time very well and complete my work and \nstudy assignments within a reasonable time frame. however, i devoted more of my time to work tasks, which caused me \nto miss the school assignments in the time frame i had planned. i had to reduce my sleep time from six to four hours to \ncomplete my school assignments on schedule. this routine left me in a very anxious and exhausted state every day, and it \nalso affected my work and study efficiency. nevertheless, i was able to finish my work assignments and finally finish all of \nthe study assignments i had planned. \nthrough this week's experience, i realized how heavy the workload is and how to ensure a standard rest time. otherwise, \nwhen this unhealthy rest time forms a pattern, it will harm work efficiency. moreover, this unhealthy rest time will \nsignificantly affect personal health. therefore, i will pay more attention to time management in my future work to ensure \nhealthy rest time. \nthe tasks for next week will still be mostly about authenticating and extracting information from european identity \ndocuments. however, since our team has already completed the authentication and extraction of all european countries \nin the existing database, the continuation of this work will depend on whether the database is updated. if the database is \nnot updated, our team will focus on the authentication and extraction of identity documents from north and south \namerica with initials a to g. \nweek 12 \nthe task for this week was to finish authenticating identity documents and make information extraction templates for \nsouth american countries with the initials a through g. the working outcomes of this week were to complete the \nauthentication of identity files, template creation, and support documentation for ecuador and brazil. i also provided a \nbetter version of the supporting document and information extraction template for the bahamas. i also presented my \nwhole internship performance in the course meeting on friday and attended a short evaluation session with truuth. \nthis week i am still under pressure. although i could adjust my schedule and complete some school assignments last \nweek, i need more time to complete them because i still have a lot of schoolwork to finish this week. as with the previous \nweek, i maintained productivity and quality due to the large amount of schoolwork i had to complete. as a result, i still \nhad to reduce my break time to complete my school assignments. for this reason, i have been feeling more stressed and \nanxious this week. so my scheduling skills need to be improved because, to a certain extent, efficiency and time \nmanagement go hand in hand. \nduring my evaluation session at truuth on friday, mike and sai gave me a comprehensive review of my entire internship, \nrecognizing my contributions and shortcomings to the projects i worked on. they thought i still had room for \nimprovement in terms of creativity in the work phase. i also realized through their evaluation that i need to pay attention \nto improving my creative skills in the future and communicate more frequently with my supervisor about my ideas. \nin conclusion, i still need to improve my work efficiency and time management through this week's internship. i am also \nmore aware of the importance of good rest in enhancing productivity. i will work hard to improve my time management \nand creative skills in the future. \nnext week will be about completing the verification of south african identity documents, creating a template for \nextracting information, and organizing my previous work in preparation for the end of my internship. \nweek 13 \nthis week is the last week of this internship. the tasks of this week consist of completing the authentication of the south \nafrican identity documents and creating the information extraction templates and the supporting documentation. i also \nhad to review all the work done during the internship and submit it to the company. this week's output consisted of \ncompleting the authentication of the south african identity document, creating the information extraction template, \ncreating the support documentation, reviewing all the previous outcomes, and submitting them to the company. \ninternship final report \ncomp8851/8860 industry based internship \n9th september 2022 \n \n13 \nthis week was the last week of the internship and the last week of the semester, so i had much work to complete. i am \nvery grateful to truuth and macquarie university for providing me with this opportunity to gain insight into the industry \nthrough my practical involvement and to provide an auspicious goal for my future direction in the industry. \nfinally, as it is the last week of the internship, there will be no work commitments next week. thanks again to macquarie \nuniversity and truuth for providing me with this opportunity. \n \n",
