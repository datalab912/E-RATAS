    "text": "week 8  \ngoals, activities and outcomes \nin the first week coming back from the middle break, i started working closely with phil. \nwe aim to have a good start which is to prepare all the work in the data planning \nphase. we aim to clarify the strategic intent and reach agreement and consensus \namong the relevant cadres, in other words, why we want to engage in this big data \nproject. we then also wanted to develop the business objectives for this project. i have \nbeen meeting with sam and phil throughout the week to communicate our strategic \nintent and to build consensus and agreement among the relevant stakeholder \ndepartments. once the strategic intent was clear, it served as a beacon of light \nthroughout the project. the next step was to translate the strategic intent into a \nstrategic plan that would give the stakeholders and staff a clear understanding of \nwhat the big data project was going to do. once the strategic planning is completed, \nthe business objectives of the big data project should be clarified. we determine what \nbusiness value the implementation of the big data project will bring to the enterprise, \n15 | p a g e  \n \nand how it will reduce costs and bring new value growth to the enterprise through \ninnovative business. \nnew knowledge, skills and experience  \nthe first week of in touch with marketing and marketing data, i understand the i need \nto pay more attention to details. marketing is a very detailed work. i previously thought \nthat i would not pay attention to so many details, why bother so much, but now i \nunderstand that it is because of so many details on the attention to a good product \nconcept. phil is also very serious and rigorous in his work. because his strategic analysis \nreally affects the company's performance. this week, i also sharpened my \ncommunication skills in meetings large and small. communicating with my colleagues \nquickly improves my communication skills. i also learned a lot of cross-departmental \ncommunication skills from phil. how to solve the problem of effective cross-\ndepartmental communication is a profound problem. because each department has \nits own interests. i learned that the first step when it comes to communication is to \nbreak the mental limits of nativism. i use a more open mind when communicating with \ncolleagues in other departments, which makes our communication efficiency \nbecome as good as it can be, and i quickly finish the interface with other departments. \nrewarding experience \nin meetings with colleagues from other departments we often encounter problems of \ndisagreement. this is the time to fight with wisdom and courage, but do not be reckless. \ni also summarized two kinds of problems for disagreement: principle and non-principal \nissues. i think people should always stick to their principles, so it is a matter of principle \nthat i will never give in. secondly, for non-principal issues, my idea is who pays for the \nresult and who is the decision maker. i always feel that the experience is to express my \nideas and thoughts reasonably and let the other party know that i am thinking. most \nof the time it is not the result that leaves an impression, but the feeling i bring to the \nperson, so it is better to express your opinion in a friendly way than to be tit-for-tat or \nto listen to what you say. \ndifficult experience \none of the things i found difficult at first was that i didn't have any background in \nmarketing. this made me worry whether i could keep up with phil's pace and \nunderstand his requirements. at the same time, phil was new to the job and didn't \nknow much about the company. he was also eager to get things done, or his \npersonality is rather eager. so, he is sometimes not very patient in explaining some \nissues to me. i think the communication between me and him needs to be further \nimproved. likewise, he is new to the company, so i need to be more tolerant of him. \ntask for the upcoming week \nin the coming week, phil and i will discuss and implement the project's execution \nguidelines and organizational support. \n16 | p a g e  \n \nweek 9  \ngoals, activities and outcomes \nthis week, we plan to complete further work to define the implementation guidelines \nfor the big data project, including basic principles of project implementation, \nprinciples of benefit sharing, principles of disagreement handling, etc. we also need \nto establish corresponding project organizations, set up project teams, clarify relevant \npositions and job responsibilities, and build organizations of different structures and \nsizes according to different strategic intentions, strategic plans, business goals and \nexecution guidelines. we had several more meetings with colleagues from his \ndepartment. together with various related departments and stakeholders, we \neffectively set up a project content planning mechanism to complete the overall \nplanning of the product (project). at the end of the week, we have completed the \nproduct (project) planning, scenario planning and requirements assessment to \ncomplete the data architecture planning from the landing point of view, architecture \nplanning is an important part of the successful landing of the project. \nnew knowledge, skills and experience  \nthis week i had a basis knowledge of affiliate marketing. it is a kind of online marketing \nmethod that pays for marketing results, that is businesses (also known as advertisers, \nvendors who sell or advertise their products and services online) use the website affiliate \nservices provided by professional affiliate marketing agencies to expand their online and \noffline business, expand sales space and sales channels, and pay for the actual results of \nmarketing. i sort of refresh and pick up my memory and skill writing sql queries. i was also \nrequired to connect sql database to python, because all query statements written in sql \ncan be implemented with pandas in python. i had a great experience of adopting pandas \ndata frame and the structure of a table in a sql database, they are very similar. they both \nconsist of data points or values, with each row having a unique index and each column \nhaving a unique name. thus, sql allows me to quickly access the specific information i \nneed for any item to working on. however, very similar queries can be made using pandas. \nrewarding experience \nduring the two weeks working with phil, i have a deeper understanding of the marketing \ndepartment. the marketing department is an important part of the marketing \norganization structure in our company, which usually contains the product marketing \ndepartment, marketing development department, marketing promotion department \nand sales support department. phil and his term are responsible for bringing the products \ncloser to the consumers' psychological distance. \ndifficult experience \nthe difficulty i had this week was refreshing my memory of the sql query course i took \nin college. i was last exposed to sql almost a year ago. i found that unlike what i was \ntaught in school, the data i was working with was much more complex, with over 100 \ntables in carclarity's database. each table had about 40-50 columns. this made it \nmuch more difficult to find useful data. also, because there was no agreed standard \n17 | p a g e  \n \nfor data entry in the early stages of the company, there was a lot of unusable data \nand missing data. it took me a long time to find useful data, but sometimes the data \nwas not what phil wanted. \ntask for the upcoming week \ni will continue working with phil for any enquires that he needed from our team. \nweek 10  \ngoals, activities and outcomes \nthe goal of this week is to continue the subsequent sessions in accordance with the \nresults of the data planning phase. the first thing to do is to have data, and to have \nhigh quality data, data in place to guarantee the effective advancement and \nexecution of the project. the first thing we do is to assess the data sources, start the \nwork related to data combing, identify the possible risks of the data sources and deal \nwith them in time. then we do data collection. data collection is a very important \nwork, and only when the data is collected can a series of big data-related work be \ncarried out. in the process of data collection, i need to pay attention to the validity of \ndata collection. i collected all the data that phil needed and pre-processed some of \nthe numbers. then the data was added and deleted for his requirements. \nnew knowledge, skills and experience  \nin week 10, i have learnt the basic concept of time series analysis. it is different from \nforecasting, and while i need time series data to make forecasts. not all time series \nanalysis is used to make forecasts. for example, time series analysis can be used to \nfind patterns or similar characteristics across multiple time series, or to perform \nstatistical process control. similarly, seasonal analysis can be used to identify patterns. \ni have the chance to get in touch with complex engineering problems based on \nscientific principles and using the scientific method, including designing experiments, \nanalysing and interpreting data, and synthesizing information to reach reasonable \nand valid conclusions. because of my basic knowledge of data science and statistical \nanalysis, it was easier for me to lean knowledge of new data analysis method. with \nthe help of sam, i really feel full of spirit to study every day and i am not feeling tired \nat all. i felt i still have so much to learn, as an intern in the workplace, non-stop learning \nis always the best attitude.  \nrewarding experience \ni learned a tip to improve the efficiency of working from home and the joy of working \nfrom home. communication is essential to working from home. communicating with \ncolleagues about projects and keeping them informed of tasks and busy schedules is \nessential to maintaining a smooth, relaxed work-from-home experience. at carclarity, \nwe use asana and microsoft teams to stay in touch and manage our projects and \ntasks. we use microsoft teams for chat and video conferencing when communicating \nand working on work details. we also use zoom to host entertaining social events, such \nas game nights and happy hours.  \n18 | p a g e  \n \ndifficult experience \nat first, i might have thought that working from home would improve my work-life \nbalance. but being in the comfort of my own home, it's easy to get caught up in my \nwork and never \"get off work\". i just sit at my desk and work endlessly with no end in \nsight, which leaves me feeling overworked and exhausted at times, but not getting \nany work done. without setting boundaries, the daunting projects and tasks to be \ndelivered immediately will always be in front of my eyes. in the office, it's easy for me \nto remember that it's time to go home when everyone is packing up and getting \nready to leave work. at home, there is no such reminder among colleagues to tell me \nthe day is over. \ntask for the upcoming week \ncontinue working with phil with any ad-hoc tasks. improve my knowledge on \nmarketing and be more familiar with the company database. \nweek 11 \ngoals, activities and outcomes \ni plan to finish my project report this week. the main purpose of this report is to let my \nsupervisor, sam, know what i have been working on with phil, the head of the \nmarketing department, for the past two weeks. to document, share my work \nexperience, and to fully document the project from start to finish. the purpose of \nproject report is to timely reflect the project progress status and internal and external \nenvironment change status, find out the existing problems and changes, analyze the \npotential risks and predict the development trend, so that the managers can make \ncorrect judgment and decision, and realize the effective control of project \nmanagement. i finished my project report very well. it included recording the brief \nprogress of the project and listing the important matters related to it. recent project \ntrends, which describe the events that will occur in the project between now and the \nnext report. a forecast and a brief description of each upcoming event. the difficulties \ni encountered while working on the project and how i overcame them. finally, a \ntimeline of the entire project is included. \nnew knowledge, skills and experience  \nthrough the documentation of this project report, i learned that different \norganizations, different departments, and different levels of personnel associated with \nthe project will provide project information reports of varying breadth and depth and \nprovide reports with varying frequency. i also gradually understood sam's \nrequirements for the reports. he wanted reports that were less detailed and \ncomprehensive in content, mostly overviews of the project's progress, and less \nfrequent reports. sam kept me practicing my project report writing skills in this way. he \nasks me to be truthful and concise in what i report. finally, i finished the project report \nwell with sam's help. i also uploaded the python code i wrote to git. \nrewarding experience \n19 | p a g e  \n \nthis internship has brought about a shift in my thinking and a change in my approach, \nand i have gained a lot. i am no longer stuck in what the senior tells me to do. i will \ntake the initiative to think about why i do what i do. the way to maximize the role of \ninternship is to understand the status and role of my work in the whole project, and \nafter this is clear, i will have a direction and goal to do everything, and then i will have \nmore motivation. if i think differently, i put myself in the same position as the company, \nso that in this process i will continue to find problems, solve problems, and summarize \nproblems. \ndifficult experience \nto older employees, the presence of interns is unimportant. therefore, in the usual \ngroup building or daily get-together, interns can easily be sidelined and isolated, \nresulting in feeling a low sense of integration. in fact, these are very good solutions, \nmainly because the mentality needs to be changed. \nfor the work of the problem, as an intern internship period is very limited, colleagues \non a variety of things are very limited understanding and ability to deal with. then as \na company, it certainly will not give you too important things. so, adjust your own \nmentality, with the purpose of learning, do a good job on their own hands on the line. \ntask for the upcoming week \nin the upcoming week. i will write report to reflect my working status and there hasn’t \nbeen a plan for next. maybe there will be ad-hoc jobs. \nweek 12 \ngoals, activities and outcomes \nas graduation time is near. i started to consider more about my future and career \nopportunity. i have reviewed myself on what i am good at and my weaknesses. my \ngoal is to try to find the gaps in my own career. the internship is not only about \nimplementing the work, but also includes the need to clarify the gaps between myself \nand my position as well as the gaps between myself and my career aspirations to \nmake a detailed and feasible plan to fill the gaps at the end of the internship. this \nweek’s activity is to learn the work and corporate standards. i need to understand the \nenterprise and the industry for each work content of the required processes and \nstandards, then i must learn the industry and the highest standards of enterprises to \nrequire themselves, with such high standards to require their own is undoubtedly to \nthe development of industry figures. i hope to get more from my internship when i look \nat it from the height of clarifying gaps to make up for shortcomings. \nnew knowledge, skills and experience  \ni am able to know how a day's work is organized, a week's work is organized, or even \na month's work is organized in this position. through actual observation, i will be able \nto understand which are the most important tasks of this position and how to operate \nthem, which are the most difficult tasks and where to start to solve these problems \nrespectively. i have improved my time management skills which is the ability to \n20 | p a g e  \n \nprocess of achieving personal or organizational goals by planning ahead and using \ncertain techniques, methods, and tools to achieve a flexible and effective use of time. \nwhen a new task comes, i would consider the prioritization. when it comes to effective \ntime management, priority cannot be overemphasized either. it can be difficult to \nknow what tasks should be tackled first, especially when so many urgent things need \nto be dealt with. however, if i've set clear goals, it's relatively easy to identify priority \nactivities. \nrewarding experience \ni started to keep a task list as known as to-do list which can help me as a reminder \nsystem that tell i what needs to be done at what time. keeping a to-do list can help \nme organize my tasks as well as handle priorities. it helps me to break down tasks and \nmanage my tasks or steps so that i never forget to do the important things. it is not \nnecessary for me to try to keep everything that needs to be done in my head. that is \nbecause in most cases, trying to remember everything will not work. instead of \nkeeping a to-do list in a notepad or journal, a simple daily, weekly or monthly plan will \ntake care of everything. \ndifficult experience \nthe formation of a good habit is not as easy as i think, because the difficulty in \ndeveloping a habit is persistence, not simply a few attempts. when i start to develop \na good habit, i tend to jump in headfirst, but i feel it is quite difficult and i tend to give \nup very fast. then i tried to look for the root cause first and do an analysis and \nassessment. for example, when i want to develop the habit of efficient time \nmanagement, the first thing you did is to analyse the problems i have now, to know \nwhy my time is chaotic and why my time utilization is low. the second thing is to find \nimprovements and solutions to these problems. i took about 2 weeks to get know \nmyself and figure these questions.  \ntask for the upcoming week  \nin the coming up week. i will be working on reporting to sam with the details of the \nproject i work to phil and the status the project.  \nweek 13  \ngoals, activities and outcomes \nmy goal for this week was to summarize my internship for the semester. and to wrap \nup all the work i am doing now, and if there is any work that cannot be completed, \nhand it over to the relevant colleagues to continue to complete. my goal for this week \nwas to summarize my internship for the semester. and to wrap up all the work i am \ndoing now, and if there is any work that cannot be completed, hand it over to the \nrelevant colleagues to continue to complete. i had a few more meetings with sam \nand jo, the project manager, mainly for me to share my internship experience. they \nalso acknowledged my work and gave me some tips on how to work. finally, they \n21 | p a g e  \n \nalso expressed their good wishes to me. i also expressed my gratitude to them and i \nam full of bright hopes for the future. \nnew knowledge, skills and experience  \nafter this internship, i learned a lot of knowledge that can't be learned from textbooks, \ni also have a great change in the employment mentality, i used to always want to \nfind a job that suits my hobby, but now i know it's hard to find a job, and it's even \nharder to match the profession, many things we first come into contact with society, \nso i can't wait for a better opportunity to come like before, and i  have to build up my \nown view of employment. i have learnt to lose dependence on school as soon as \npossible, learn to be independent in society, dare to participate in the competition \nwith society, dare to bear the social pressure, so that i can grow up fast in society. in \nis to keep a thinking and learning heart. as a college student, the most important thing \nis my own ability to think about learning. \nrewarding experience \nwhat makes me feel especially good is that all my colleagues take special care of \nme. especially sam, who was my tutor in college, and it was a coincidence that he \nand i met again at carclarity. he always encouraged me to keep refining my coding \nskills and kept me in touch with the company's big and small issues. i have had many \nvaluable experiences. \ndifficult experience \nit's always especially hard to say goodbye, and i'll he on my job search. i hope \ncarclarity's performance will get better and better. \ntask for the upcoming week \nthere is no time to waste, i will start job hunting next week. \n",
