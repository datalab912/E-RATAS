And so on while \nthe word \u2018I\u2019 stands for interpretation of the events which occurred during this program and \nhave detailed about new insights, my connection with other attendees presented in  this \nprogram, my feelings towards them, the team work if there\u2019s any involved, my hypothesis \nfollowed by conclusion and then we have the word \u2018E\u2019 which sums up the efficiency of what \nI have observed, my opinion regarding those observations, effectiveness of observation and \non what grounds I am making these experiences count, last but not the least we have the \nword \u2018P\u2019 which stands for planning of how this learning experience is useful in future for my \ncareer and what its serves in the long professional run and what are my recommendations.  \nAll the fellow activates and task happened under the supervision of the mentor Ivan \nBakhshayeshi and the coordinator of this program who is Jennifer Yang.  \n \n \nWEEK#07 \n \nIn the 7th week we have kick start of the project, in 1st session of the week was all about \nconsultation hour where we discussed the overview of the project and my mentor Mr. Ivan \nhas demonstrated the project\u2019s aim and purpose and importance of this deep learning \nproject in the real world.  \nWhile discussing the project outcomes, we come across that this is the very vast project and \nhas previously been worked on but still it does have so many features which can be \nintegrated with it, this session we discussed that our mentor has also worked in this kind of \nproject in his professional life and how hard it is to work with big data in cooperation with \nthis kind of application.  \nOur mentor has also discussed what are the protocols to work on this project where we \ncome across that from now on after easter break we will have two session per week same \nas past but in the first session we will assign the task related to the project and in the \nsecond session we all have present our work to the mentor.  \nIn this meeting we have also discussed the related problems regarding this project and \neveryone has a say who related to the data science background what we have achieve in \nour university times and what deep learning projects we have worked with on academic \nlevel and in the end, we have been assigned to study related or similar problems of face \nrecognition systems and how deep we can go and what challenges we can face while \nworking on this application. The enthusiasm and support from the mentor were pretty high \nwhich gives me motivation to do better.  \nIn the 2nd session we discussed the related problems and challenges which needs to \novercome while working on this project. The libraries we have explored related to face \nrecognition system been discussed to and to what extend we should take this project been \n \n15 \nhighlighted too. In the end, we got our rescheduled for the upcoming sessions and how we \nwill proceed with these in future after easter break.  \nIn conclusion, so we have great learning environment provided by ITIC team and all our \nqueries has been entertained from both our mentor and Ms. Jennifer. \n \n \nThis reflective journal holds the detailed events\u2019 entries till week#7 as we will go forward \nthere\u2019s going to be new findings, observations and learning experiences will come by time. \nThe project has been kicked in from the last week and as by mentor there\u2019s going be one \nsession per week which will be reserved for consultation and the other one would use for \npresentation of the work we will perform and keeping in loop with Mr. Ivan would help me \nto get better learning outcomes out of this program, so far this is what I have observed, He \nalso mentioned that in consulting session we all will be provided with different task which \nwe need to practice and present in the second session and these meetings would be really \nprofessional where you have to come up with different ideas and professional mindset \nalong with the research work home work so you can answer all the related queries of the \nattendees.  \n \nWEEK#08 \n \nThe 8th week is started with project initialization.  \nThis week, we have discussed about the objective of the project, where our mentor \nexplained what we are going to working on, which is going to be a student attendance \nsystem by using face recognition method. This project will be able to detect the faces of the \nstudent through live camera which helps the teachers to mark student attendance in online \nclasses. To start working on this project first we need background knowledge of the \nobjective and the available packages, so Mr. Ivan has shared quite good knowledge and \nmaterial of how these application works and their specifications.  \nWe have been assigned the task to start creating database by using TensorFlow data \naugmentation technique and explore all the related like image data generator and create \nand data base to start working, we all have to create a database of at least 20 images by \nusing keras data augmentation techniques and shared it around so we can go further from \nthere.  \nTo learn and explore about this project is an interesting part and working with the \nprofessional mentor helping me to clear my theories which I was shy enough to ask in my \nclass.  \n \n \n \n \n16 \nWEEK#09 \nThe 9th week is started working on the project.  \nThis week, we have discussed about the how to create the database for the project, our \nMentor has shown us how it needs to be done share some resources for the reference as \nwell, we have started making database that consists of images of the student, we are all \nadvised to share our databases with each other so we can test our model and get better and \naccurate results.  \nThe database should be created by using python library CV2 which will access your live \ncamera take snapshot which should be uploaded on some medium to be shared across the \nmates, so far, we are successful to create our individual datasets now we need to use keras \ndata augmentation techniques to train our data and get the results. In the first meeting we \nhave presented our datasets and discussed the issues facing while creating them.  \nWe have been assigned the task to start working with the database by using TensorFlow \ndata augmentation technique and do data augmentation by using keras libraries and \nexplore all its face recognition related tools.  \n \nWEEK#10 \nThe 10th week is making progress on the project.  \nThis week, we have presented our initial work to our mentor which is created databases, \nthis week while working on project I have explored CV2 libraries which use to classifier as \ndata collected before that was not very much productive so I am improving my data \ncollection process for which I have explored CV2 frontal face classifier and capture 100 more \npictures so we can have more data to work with, As presented to Mr. Ivan we have \ndiscussed that this is an good approach for collection of data. The next step is augmentation \nof keras, I have explored few keras applications like VGG16 for classification of data by using \nVGG16 I have so far successful to train my model which is giving me quite good accuracy but \nit needs to be mitigated as I believe my model is overfitting on my current data while \ndiscussing these points to our mentor, we have tried few things and he suggested to try \nsome other application of kera which are imageDataGenerator and, etc.  \nWe have assigned to go on the next step which is recognition as far we are quite on track \nand on timeline with the project meanwhile, I am trying to work on how to use facenet and \nother application available for that I am going through some research and making good use \nof papers available regarding face recognition.  \n \n \n \n \n17 \nWEEK#11 \n \nThe 11\nth week is resolving discrepancies in the project.  \nThis week, we have discussed about the challenges we are getting while working on the \nproject, in the first session of this week we have presented the updates on your projects \nwhich was the one step up in the work of face recognition. I have successfully trained few \nmodels over my data but also while discussing the issues facing, I have found out that I need \nto try to use different approach and our mentor has shown us few different libraries which \nare available and would be much easier to resolve the accuracy issues I am facing while \nworking on the environment. In the second session we have discussed the market of data \nscience industry and quite few insights of what and how we all can get ready ourselves for \nthe coming chapter of our lives and also while discussing on project we have resolved some \nimportant issues related to CV2 libraries, also to go forward we have been assigned a task to \ntry use face recognition library which has C++ features and how we can integrate it with our \nproject to get better results and mark attendance in csv file.  \nSo far, we have done augmentation which is the labelling of the data, then we have done \nthe classification which is comparing and telling us which class the data belongs too now we \nare working on the marking the attendance by comparing the face from webcam and mark \nthe personnel attendance in the csv file.  \nWEEK#12 \n \nThe 12th week is discussing the new findings and work environment.  \n \nIn the first session we have discussed the issues we are facing in the project by using face \nrecognition library of python which is already been build and to incorporate it with our \nenvironment I was getting few errors which I have discussed with the mentor and we found \na better solution regarding that issue, in this meeting everyone has discussed what they \nhave learned so far and how it\u2019s helping them to get done this project and for the next \nsession we have been asked to have a presentation to show what we have done so far on \nthe project and present it as our final presentation of this internship.  \n \nIn the second session we have been asked to present our project in form of presentation, I \nhave presented my project in PPT and so far, get succussed to achieve the objective of the \nproject.  \nThis was our last session as an internee and we exchange feedback of the program overall \nand Mr. Ivan gave us few tips on how we can make our resume better and how to get \nprepared for the interviews and what resources we can use for job application."
