company and watch the tutorials and \nguidelines to learn tableau.  \nthe it team took a little more time to set up my account due to which i was unable to access \nthe system of the company. my supervisor brendan mathias was guiding me with the \nagreement papers and what i need to submit to hr. in my first week, i worked from home and \nwent through several tutorials on tableau and learned the basics of how to connect the excel \ndata to build graphs and tables. \nnew knowledge, skills, or experiences \nin week 1, my aim was to learn the basics of tableau. as i could not access the resources of \nthe company, i was not exactly sure about what i needed to do. my aim for the week was to \nfamiliarise myself with tableau. from watching the guidelines and tutorials i got the basic \nknowledge about data visualisation tools and understood that it is useful for reporting and \nanalysing the data of the company. self-learning is always challenging and fun therefore, in \nthe first week i was just exploring the software and learning how to use the excel data. \nrewarding experience  \ni always wanted to an internship program with cochlear limited and getting an opportunity to \nwork with the company in a real-world environment was rewarding experience for me.  \ndifficult experience  \ni had to officially start my internship from week 4 due to the delay in setting up my account \nearly in the week. i was a little worried about the deadline of my internship proposal. \nupcoming week tasks \nin my second week, i was required to do all the setup which is necessary to get started and \nwork for the project and understanding about the project in more detail. \ninternship final report | supriya basnet \n15 \n \nweek 2 \ngoals, activities and outcomes \nthe goal for the second week was to get access to the resources and familiarise myself with \nthe dataset of the products and tableau. i attended the induction and learned about how to \nsecurely use the resources of the company and how we can request access to various software \nand tools necessary for the project. i had a conversation with my manager, brendan mathias, \nfirst where he explained my responsibilities. my manager booked introduction meetings for \nme with all the team members that i am working with. during the meeting, they introduced \nthemselves, welcomed me, and explained to me the projects that they are working on. i was \nalso given the opportunity to introduce myself in the weekly stand-up meeting where all the \nteam members share their weekly learnings and win for the previous week. this helped me to \nstart early connections with the office colleagues and to gain familiarity with the company. i \nalso got an overview of my duties and what i need to work on. \ni was then assigned to do the mandatory courses at cochlear academy where i studied the \nglobal code of conduct, different policies of the company, respectful workplace, and security \nawareness. i then requested access to various software and tools such as tableau, tableau prep \nbuilder, and microsoft teams to attend various meetings and to contact the team members \neasily. \nnew knowledge, skills and experiences \nin second week, i learned about the product of the company and got the gist of how the work \nis divided and performed. got overview of the product such as implants, sound processor, \nconnected care, and upgrades provided by cochlear limited. also learned about demographics, \ncustomers, and segments of the product. the skills that i learned was communication, \nexploration of data using tableau, data discovery.  \nrewarding experience  \nthe rewarding experience for me was doing an internship program in a real-world \nenvironment, working from the office and attending the formal as well as semi-formal \nmeetings, and understanding the corporate work culture. meeting all the team members and \nunderstanding the importance of teamwork and how things work. \ndifficult experience \nit was a rewarding experience to go to the office and meet everyone, but it was difficult to \nunderstand all the business terms and understanding the data set of the products as i was not \nfamiliar with the products and their codes. being someone who cannot start a conversation, i \nwas a bit nervous about how i am going to present myself to all the team members. \nupcoming weeks task \nin my third week, i will need to understand the dataset provided and replicate the data \nvisualisation which was made in hyperion to tableau. \n \n \ninternship final report | supriya basnet \n16 \n \nweek 3 \ngoals, activities and outcomes \nthe goal for the third week was to understand the dataset so that i would be able to replicate \nthe pre-existing dashboard made in excel to the tableau. with the help of my supervisor ash \nmaini, we started working on the dashboard as he gave me a clear understanding of the dataset \nexplaining the product and which group it falls under.  \nthe activities that i performed this week were attending several meetings with the manager \nand team members, also attended the stand-up meeting which usually takes place on tuesdays, \ndiscussed various ideas about how we can efficiently extract the data set from various sources \nsuch as salesforce, hyperion, and obie. started with a line chart to replicate the dashboard by \ntransforming the data. also attended a few of the cochlear academy courses to understand \nmore about the company. \nthe outcomes for this week were learning about the sound processor in more detail, \nsuccessfully replicating a graph from the existing dashboard, getting an understanding of how \nwe can use tableau, and building various charts for analysing. \nnew knowledge, skills, or experience \nto obtain better hands-on knowledge, i completed the tutorials provided on the tableau \nwebsite which my manager suggested i have a look at. i also went through a few youtube \ntutorials to expand my knowledge of the different functionalities of tableau. i also learned \nabout how we can raise a problem faced while working and how we can work in a team to \nsolve the problem which might be faced by multiple team members. the experience was quite \nchallenging. it was a little difficult to understand the data set as i was not familiar with the \nacronyms which were used during the reporting. \nrewarding experience  \nthe rewarding experience for me this week was to be able to share my learnings and wins in \nthe stand-up meeting and i was able to replicate one of the graphs from the existing dashboard. \ngetting insights into different products made by cochlear gave me an overview of what sort of \nproducts we deliver to the customers.  \ndifficult experience \nthe experience that was particularly difficult for me was to transform the excel data into the \ntableau accepted format. i had the difficulty because my excel knowledge was a bit rusted and \ni used it when i was doing my undergraduate degree and it took a bit of time to work around \nit.   \nupcoming weeks task  \nin the upcoming week four, the principal task was to understand the dataset of sound processors \nin more depth and replicating most of the dashboard data visualisation which was made in \nhyperion. \n \ninternship final report | supriya basnet \n17 \n \nweek 4 \ngoals, activities and outcomes \n \nfor week four, the main goal was to undertake an assessment of the expected time required to \nrender the excel dashboard into tableau. i analysed the dashboard created in excel and \nunderstood most of the graph. the activities performed in week 4 are:  \n• analysing the dashboard for a better understanding  \n• attended various meetings and discussions where different topics such as data lake, \ncompanies’ growth, and various other updates were mentioned by the team members.  \n• attended weekly stand-up meetings and shared the weekly learnings and wins.  \ni shared the progress with my manager on replicating the existing dashboard and got feedback \non how we can still improve the graphs. the outcomes for this week were learning about the \nexisting problems faced while extracting the data and while doing the analysis on data, \nsuccessfully replicating a few of the graphs in the tableau, and learning more about the features. \nnew knowledge, skills, or experience \nin week 4, i attended lots of meetings and discussions with the team members. i got some ideas \nabout what a dashboard should look like as the business analytics and insights manager walked \nme through the source starter system where she explained about oracle (erp), salesforce \nclassic (rm), the platforms used such as oracle data warehouse, user interface level such as \nhyperion, and obiee, etc.  \nrewarding experience  \nthe rewarding experience was to be able to understand the different requirements of the \ncompany. being more comfortable using tableau, replicating the graphs, showing the progress \nto the manager, and getting the feedback from both manager and supervisor. \ndifficult experience \nas i was still not familiar with the company’s detail and departments it was difficult for me to \nunderstand the information shared by all the team members during the stand-up meetings.  \nupcoming weeks task  \nthe principal task for next week will be completing the dashboard for sound processor. \nweek 5 \ngoals, activities and outcomes \nin week 5, the main goal was to complete the dashboard for sound processor. just like the \nprevious week attended the weekly stand-up meeting and replicated the graphs correctly. my \nmanager introduced me to tableau prep- builder and suggested i use the tool to transform the \ndata instead of transforming it in excel. re-built the graphs by transforming the data using the \nprep builder. the outcomes for this week are:  \n• learned about how we can easily transform, clean, and pivot the tables using tableau \nprep builder.  \n• learned about different features that exist in tableau  \n• replicated most of the graph correctly. \ninternship final report | supriya basnet \n18 \n \n• only left with one graph to finish the dashboard for the sound processor. as i work \nthree days a week, this week i had severe migraine due to which i had to take leave on \nfriday 25th of march.   \nnew knowledge, skills, or experience \nduring week 5, i learned about tableau prep builder and various features in tableau where \nwe can easily plot the graphs and use various filters, calculated fields, and other various \nanalyses. the skills learned are how we can easily clean, and transform the data using the tool, \ncommunication, and how we should present ourselves and the ideas to all the team members. \nrewarding experience  \nthe rewarding experience was to almost complete the dashboard successfully. \ndifficult experience \nthis week was little more difficult for me as i was not feeling that well due to which it was \naffecting my performance. as i am still in the learning phase of tableau, sometimes it gets \nquite challenging to find what i exactly need to do. while i was replicating one of the graph \nand table, i was getting different result even though i was using the same data set and formula \nto calculate the value. \nupcoming weeks task  \nthe principal task for the next week is to finalise the sound processor dashboard and get started \nwith understanding the implant dataset.  \nweek 6 \ngoals, activities and outcomes \nthe main goal for sixth week was to finalise the dashboard by completing the remaining table \nof the existing dashboard. the activities performed in this week were attending the stand-up \nmeeting and attending the meeting with the supervisor and manager to clear the confusion \nwhich i was facing with the table that i was trying to replicate. learned about the implants and \ngot the feedbacks on arranging the dashboard.  \nnew knowledge, skills, or experience \nweek 6 had provided me experience in using tableau and i learned about the various functions \nthat can be used in tableau’s table calculation functions such as index (), lookup (), rank \n(), and additional functions like ltrim (), rtrim (), etc.  \nrewarding experience  \nrewarding experience for this week was getting positive feedback from the supervisor and \nmanager about the dashboard. \ndifficult experience \nthis week the difficult experience that i felt was, i was getting confused with the table and i \nwas struggling to solve the problem.

\nthe rewarding experiences this week was making progress in the implant dashboard in a short \nperiod of time. \n \ndifficult experience \nthe experience that was difficult for me this week was not being able to understand the data \nstructure of a particular dataset due to which i was not able to solve the variance table problem. \nupcoming weeks task  \nthe main task for next week was to complete the implant dashboard after getting the updated \ndataset and try to update the sound processor dashboard with a newly updated dataset. \nweek 10 \ngoals, activities and outcomes \nthe goal for week 10 was to complete the implant dashboard and update the sound processor \ndashboard but as we wanted to implement self-service, we decided to make the dashboard \nconsistent with the other dashboards on other platforms. therefore, later the goal for this week \nwas to standardize the data set structure with the other dataset. the activities for this week were \nattending various meetings and discussions where different topics such as self-service, \nstandardizing the data, and updates of the tableau dashboard. i also got to share the progress of \ndashboard migration with the team members in the stand-up meeting. \n \nthe outcome for this week were, learned about self-service in more detail and tried applying \nthe concept learned about self-service in the dashboard. also decided to make a summary of \nthe sound processor dashboard and added a few new graphs from the dataset extracted from \nhyperion. \n \nnew knowledge, skills, or experience \nthe knowledge acquired this week was how important it is to have consistency in all the \ndashboards that are used in the company. for clear insight from the dashboard without making \nthe user confused, having a consistent color scheme in all the dashboards is another important \nthing that i learned. the experience this week was a little stressful and challenging, i was stuck \nwith a few problems and later discussing the problem with the team member and manager we \nconcluded that we have to re-structure the data for consistency and redo the dashboard in \ntableau. \n \nrewarding experience \nthe rewarding experiences this week was finalising the summary view of the dashboard and \nadding new graphs to the summary dashboard. \n \ndifficult experience \nas mentioned in the experience section, the experience that was particularly difficult was \nhaving to redo the extraction and restructure of the dataset. \n \nupcoming weeks task  \nthe principal task for next week was completing the summary
