    "text": "week 1: \ngoals, activities and outcomes \nthis week was all about getting an internship with a company. fortunately, the company i am currently working \nfor, ecolab, decided it was perfectly fine for me to perform my internship there. i spoke to my supervisors and \ninformed them of the requirements of comp8851 internship stream.  \n \ndifficult experiences \ni felt nervous being introduced to a new department and fellow team members. week 1, we had small \nintroductions and the team helped fill me on the overall data migration process, which made me feel \noverwhelmed. after seeing all 4 main systems, i found netsuite and sap to be very complex pieces of software. \n \ntasks for upcoming week \nthe upcoming week was where the work for the internship really began, as the main task was for me to learn the 4 \nmain systems. luckily the position i currently work in as a master data officer, allowed me to be familiar with 2 \nof the major systems (masterpack and jde oracle). \n \nweek 2: \ngoals, activities and outcomes \nthis week was all about sourcing data. met with team and was show step by step what the process looked like for \neach of the 4 main systems. i was then asked to replicate what i was shown to give the team and myself a little bit \nof confidence since everyone was on a weekly deadline. part of the process was analyzing large data sets, creating \nlabelled folders, and organizing the data in excel sheets. \n \nnew knowledge, skills and experiences \nwas taught in a brief period the main aspects of sourcing data. this gave me a new perspective on the internal \nprocesses involved within a large company in extracting data from its own major systems. \n \nrewarding experiences \nbeing able to complete tasks before they were due, being acknowledged for the work that i and each team \nmember has put in. \n \ndifficult experiences \ngetting overwhelmed with the amount of data collected and data that has yet to be collected. since this process \nhas been ongoing for the past 3 years, the amount of data was exorbitant. \n \ntasks for upcoming week \nsimilar to week 2, i continued sourcing data and performing my given activities and duties. i was tasked with \npresenting the following week and thereafter the progress of the team to a senior it manager within the company. \n \n \n \n14 \n \ninternship final report  \ncomp8851 industry based internship                                          3 june 2022 \n \nweek 3: \ngoals, activities and outcomes \nthis week was similar to week 2 and was all about sourcing data. i was further taught how company methods to \nsource relevant data for the systems migration to oracle. this included excel formulas and smart queries on \nmasterpack. performed my first presentation, with nothing major to report. outcomes for week 3 were being able \nto understand the various methods used in data sourcing as well as having learnt the excel formulas to sort data to \nwhat the company requires. \n \nnew knowledge, skills and experiences \ni learnt new excel formulas such as concat and sort index along with masterpack smart queries for data \nextraction. understanding the communication dynamics with each team member and learning about who is in \ncharge on what activities and processors. normally this would have been accomplished earlier, however the team \nwas incredibly busy to give me every detail in the first 2 weeks.  \n \nrewarding experiences \nbeing complemented on my work ethic and for asking lots of questions. other experiences included going the \nextra mile and doing more than what my superior asked me to do. i was proactive during my breaks to go and \nfamiliarize myself with each team members roles and responsibilities. \n \ndifficult experiences \nworking under pressure to get as much done as possible since this project is a massive undertaking with a 2-year \ndeadline. learning how to use 3 different systems and extract specific data from each one as well as organize the \ndata files to keep track of them.  \n \ntasks for upcoming week \nin the upcoming week, i will be accumulating data. after sourcing the data, we then accumulate it in spreadsheets \nand ensure data completeness and accuracy. i also engaged in weekly one-on-one meetings with my supervisor to \nensure she knew what i have been doing throughout my internship.  \n \nweek 4: \ngoals, activities and outcomes \nweek 4 involved accumulating the data. whilst in week 3 i handled some organization of the data file types; this \nweek was more heavily involved in accumulating the data files into set folders jointly with learning how to extract \ndata from sap. \n \nnew knowledge, skills and experiences \ni learnt how to accumulate data from sap, which was rewarding in its own way since i never really liked sap \nsoftware. my excel organizational skills improved along with the pace at which i was extracting and accumulating \ndata. \n \nrewarding experiences \nlots of team support and engagement throughout the whole 2 and half days. lots of discussions revolving around \nnew data innovations and how they can be of benefit to the teams’ own processes. \n15 \n \ninternship final report  \ncomp8851 industry based internship                                          3 june 2022 \n \ndifficult experiences \nworking under pressure to get as much done as possible. every week i had be pay attention to everything and take \nallot of notes for each new process as the work and knowledge started to pile up.  \n \ntasks for upcoming week \nin the upcoming week are set to identify missing data and analyze data weaknesses in our missing data and look at \nways to prevent it in the future. \n \nweek 5: \ngoals, activities and outcomes \nweek 5 involved locating missing data. i had to use new skills and formulas for this process. we had team \ndiscussions on how missing data would be sourced for each major system, since each system was different, and \neach required a different approach. part of the activities involved reviewing pathways to data breaches and \nchecking data processers to identify links to missing data in each major system. we ended up finding few links to \nwhy our data had missing values in it. one of the main links is that the software’s are old, and some of the more \nmodern data extraction techniques utilized, resulted in missing data. \n \nnew knowledge, skills and experiences \ni learnt how to review and analyzing loopholes in software and how the software itself results in missing data. \n \nrewarding experiences \nlots of team support and engagement throughout the whole 2 and half days. this week was rewarding in the \nsense that i was making less mistakes along the way and slowly catching up to pace with my team. \n \ndifficult experiences \nin team discussion, a lot of system integration terminology was brought up and it was a challenge to understand \nand digest the nature of the discussions and as a result had to ask lots of questions. \n \ntasks for upcoming week \nthis week was revolved around missing data management. next week we are set to analyze ways to prevent \nmissing data from occurring going forward. \n \n \nweek 6: \ngoals, activities and outcomes \nweek 6 i was involved in team discussions and strategies to prevent missing data from occurring. part of the \nactivities included team meetings attendance, reviewing missing data and where it came from, identifying ways to \nprevent data and implementing them. and the outcomes were managing to identify main areas and origins of \nmissing data and then implemented methods and strategies to prevent missing data from occurring in the future. \n \n \n \n \n16 \n \ninternship final report

extracting techniques and to extract data with lower \nnull values in spreadsheets. part of this involved using excel formulas to locate null values and remove them. \nexperienced gained in learning to identify weaknesses in systems and how prevent missing data from occurring in \ndata extraction. \n \nrewarding experiences \nlots of team support and engagement throughout the whole 2 and half days. along with engagement from other \ndepartments such as the it department who lent their expertise to our team to help figure out system weaknesses \nand identify ways to prevent/ lower the chances of having missing data from extraction processes. \n \ndifficult experiences \nimplanting new methods and techniques required a student’s mindset as there was a new learning curve presented. \ni found it particularly challenging to balance my working job with my internship this week as the workload had \nincreased in my normal job. \n \ntasks for upcoming week \nthis week was revolved
