    "text": "week 1 \ngoals, activities and outcomes \nthe 1st-week goal was to get familiar with the various aspects of the \ninternship and the organisation. an overview of the organisation information \nand project background was provided to make us more aware of the learning \nobjectives. wireshark, a packet capturing tool that is used in real-world \ninvestigations was talked about and how through practical lab exercises we \ncould enhance wireshark skills was discussed more in detail.\nnew knowledge, skills and experience \nin the 1st week, i learnt about what is incident response and 7 phases of the \nincident response life cycle. furthermore, the concept of attack life cycle \nwhere the seven stages of this model were discussed in depth. however, i \nalso learned that not all seven stages of the attack life cycle are always part \nof an attack. later, 10 steps to help reduce incidents were shared which i \nfound very interesting. \nrewarding experience \nit was indeed a very rewarding experience as i got to learn a lot about \nnetwork and system incidents from the professionals. and, to be able to work \non wireshark and gain the practical skills needed to investigate and respond \nto these incidents got me really excited. \ndifficult experience \nwith everything being very new as expected while starting interning at an \norganisation in early days, i was very nervous during my 1st week. besides \nall the excitement for learning new concepts, i felt a bit overwhelmed and \nstruggled with reaching out to other professionals for help and queries.\n               comp8851/comp8860 industry based internship 3 june 2022 \nthe task for the upcoming week \nin the coming week, lot of other interesting and intriguing concepts like legal \nchallenges in digital investigations and challenges to cyber crime \ninvestigations were going to be discussed. these concepts really piqued my \ninterest and i looked forward to learning more in depth about them.\nweek 2\ngoals, activities and outcomes \nthis week my goal was to become more at ease with myself and the \norganisation. i tried to be more social and engaged in discussions with other \nteam members which helped me to alleviate all the nervousness that i had \nbeen feeling. i was able to focus better on the tasks assigned for this week \nwhich revolved around threat landscape and challenges faced in cyber crime \ninvestigations. \nnew knowledge, skills and experience \ni was very excited to learn about the components of threat landscape and \nhow the internet and computer technologies have drastically reshaped the \nthreats that are being posed to modern society and the ways we defend \nagainst them. economics crime and identity theft was one of the components \nthat captured my interest the most as it is so prevalent these days. \nfurthermore, there was a good discussion around the legal challenges in \ndigital investigation and how evolving privacy and data protection regulations \nacross geographies may add to the complexity of gathering digital evidence.\nrewarding experience \nto be able to have healthy discussions about the challenges discussed above \nwas one of the main highlights for me this week. i really enjoyed talking and \nlearning about the common vulnerabilities and exposure challenges faced by \nthe industrialised nations in the form of trespass and fraud.\ndifficult experience \nas much as i found the learnings very thought provoking, i found it a bit \ndifficult to wrap my head around all the remediation steps that are taken by \nthe companies like microsoft, and qualys. i needed to get around the vast \nsample of about 25000 vulnerability signatures contained in their knowledge-\nbase to get a better understanding of how they deal with new threats that \nemerge everyday.\n               comp8851/comp8860 industry based internship 3 june 2022 \nthe task for the upcoming week\nthe focus of the upcoming week was going to be about defining the incident \nresponse and how the internal and external communication procedures are \nimperative to identify threats and restore systems. \nweek 3\ngoals, activities and outcomes \nin this week, i learnt a great deal about how crucial it is for an organisation to \nhave a fully effective incident response plan in place and how to build a field \nforensic kit. the goal of this week was to learn how to prepare for incident \nresponse investigations as it is a critical part of a successful cybersecurity \nprogram.\nnew knowledge, skills and experience \nas discussed above, the emphasis this week was on how to build an effective \nincident response capability and preparing for incident response \ninvestigations since a great deal of information has been lost in organisations \nthat do not have a functional incident response program. \ni studied in depth regarding the softwares, virtual machine platforms and disk \nimaging tools that were being used by forensic teams. as softwares are \nrequired for more than acquisition, like for the creation of ioc’s, log analysis, \nand reporting, it was important for me to be able to gain a better \nunderstanding of them.\nrewarding experience \nwith each passing week, i started to enjoy my internship more and more as it \nbecame more challenging and interesting at the same time. finding out so \nmuch more about the different kinds of software being used and the other \ngood information security practices to enhance the remediation process made \nme even more interesting in what i was doing. \ndifficult experience \nlearning how to use new softwares and what tools to use in specific \nsituations was a bit intimidating for me because i struggled with trying to keep \nup with all the new technologies that are being currently used. but the \napproach to try to understand what software one needs by better \nunderstanding the situation and policies, encouraged me to pursue my this \nknowledge further.\n               comp8851/comp8860 industry based internship 3 june 2022 \nthe task for the upcoming week \nin the coming week, the difficulties i faced during this week about \nvulnerability assessment and management were going to be addressed. \nmore on network baselining was also going to discussed.\nweek 4\ngoals, activities and outcomes \nthis week, goal was to study more in depth about the vulnerability program \nand what a typical vulnerability scenario looks like. it is important to \nunderstand how vulnerability assessments are performed to make the \nprocess fully effective. this week aimed at encouraging me to learn more \nabout vulnerability scanning software tools like qualys cloud suite, alibaba \nwebsite threat inspector that constantly monitor applications and networks to \nidentify potential security vulnerabilities. \nnew knowledge, skills and experience \ni knew about risk assessment but during this week i learnt that vulnerability \nassessment is not the same as risk assessment. vulnerability assessment is \na primary tool used to identify and track weaknesses that can be exploited by \nthreats and is a part of the risk assessment process. moreover, it was very \nalluring to learn about the software tools that are being used by companies \nlike qualys, alibaba, and ibm to monitor their applications. \nrewarding experience \nwhat really made me look forward to this week was to learn more about the \ndifferent tool kits used by major companies for vulnerability scanning. ibm \nguardium vulnerability assessment piques my interest and i was encouraged \nto research on it further for a better understanding with the help of my \nseniors. \ndifficult experience \ntrying to learn new software tools at first seemed very challenging with all the \nother learning that was going on. but i am very grateful to my seniors who \nwere there at every step of the way for me. \nthe task for the upcoming week \nin the coming week, the focus was going to be threat identification and ioc \ncreation which is the iterative process of documenting the characteristics of \nan incident in a structured manner. i was excited to learn the key concepts \nand this critical skill required for effective incident response\n               comp8851/comp8860 industry based internship 3 june 2022 \nweek 5\ngoals, activities and outcomes \nthe goal this week was to learn about indicators of compromise(ioc’s) and \nthe iterative lead gathering process where you first have to gather the initial \nleads and begin the ioc creation process, then collect relevant evidence \nfollowed by analysing the data for new leads. as it was important  to \nunderstand the lifecycle of indicator generation, this week aimed at being \nfully aware of malicious activities in real time.\nnew knowledge, skills and experience \ni learnt a lot of new skills during this week such as event based alerting \nwhich is the form of monitoring to which most incident response and it \npersonnel are accustomed accompanied by snort rules which help in \ndifferentiating between normal internet activities and malicious activities. i \ncame across this very interesting principal i.e. locard’s principle of exchange \nwhich states that when a person or object comes into contact with another \nperson pr object, a cross-transfer of materials occurs. i found it very thought-\nprovoking as it made me understand how all evidence must be collected.\nrewarding experience \nthe rewarding experience was definitely the time when we learnt in depth \nabout kali linux, burpsuite and wireshark during this week where we were \nmade to discuss these tools and have a very engaging conversation \nregarding how to monitor threats and vulnerabilities. i believe that this \nexperience will surely help me in my career in the future.\ndifficult experience \nthe learning objectives this week motivated me to work on wireshark myself \nand came across a lot of challenges while doing so. i started working on \nanalysing the p caps and i found it hard to read the files and filter packets. \nafter spending enough time and efforts, i finally got the results i hoped for.\n               comp8851/comp8860 industry based internship 3 june 2022 \nthe task for the upcoming week \nin the coming week, the focus was going to be threat identification and ioc \ncreation which is the iterative process of documenting the characteristics of \nan incident in a structured manner. i was excited to learn the key concepts \nand this critical skill required for effective incident response\nweek 6\ngoals, activities and outcomes \nthe goals for this week was to become more aware of the threat intelligence \ncollection as this intelligence can be used to inform decisions regarding the \nsubject’s response to threat and vulnerabilities. moreover, data forensics \nand analysis was also studied in detail as it is a detailed investigation for \ndetecting and documenting the incident response.\nnew knowledge, skills and experience \nunderstanding the maneuver warfare mindset and the threat intelligence \ncycle which includes intelligence collection and processing, analysis and \nproduction, and planning and direction were some of the new skills and new \nlearning experiences that i had during this week. i had bare knowledge of \ndata forensics and analysis, but during this week i got to learn where the \ndata is stored and about malware detection strategy. \nrewarding experience \nas i have been progressing through my internship, i am having a great \nlearning experience. being able to gain so much knowledge about things i \nhave always been so fascinated by, makes me really grateful for this \nexperience. \ndifficult experience \nforensic analysis has been a very uncharted territory for me and studying so \nmany new things about it made it hard for me to keep up with it. as much as i \nwas enjoying my learning process, at times i struggled with keeping up with \nthe scope of these technologies as they are very vast concepts and use so \nmany different analysis methods.\nthe task for the upcoming week\ni am most looking forward to the next week as we finally start the practical \nlabs and the project work on circadence which uses its current cyber range \nsolution and next generation cybersecurity training platform to address \n               comp8851/comp8860 industry based internship 3 june 2022 \nnational security challenges. a list of the supporting resources from the media \ncentre has been provided to us and we have been encouraged to spend time \nnavigating the media centre and become familiar with the available \nresources. \nweek 7 \ngoals, activities and outcomes\nin week 7, we finally start the practical labs and the project work on \ncircadence which uses its current cyber range solution and next generation \ncybersecurity training platform to address national security challenges. a list \nof the supporting resources from the media centre was provided to us and \nwe were encouraged to spend time navigating the media centre and become \nfamiliar with the available resources. \nnew knowledge, skills and experience \nafter i started my training at the battle school, i accessed the media centre. i \nlearnt about different resource options like general cybersecurity and \ndefensive specialisation that contained resources to assist us with the lab. \nthe majority of resources in the general cybersecurity section contained \nlinux fundamentals where i learnt a great deal about linux commands and \nits fundamentals. \nrewarding experience \nit was very exciting to finally start the project ares training as it has been long \nawaited. i had already studied linux but during this training i was motivated to \nstudy about its origin and different linux distributions. linux fundamentals by \npaul cobbaut encouraged me to practice each command while sitting next to \na working linux computer. it was a great learning experience that set the right \ntone for the upcoming weeks.\ndifficult experience \ninitially, i faced difficulty with installing linux debian 8 as a virtual machine in \nvirtualbox. i also did some basic configuration of this new machine like \nsetting an ip address and fixing a hostname so i could practice linux \ncommands. my system displayed “device full” error while installing which was \na clear cut sign that i had run out of space when installing the software. then, \ni recreated my filesystems with the mke2fs command, which deleted the \npartially installed software. i then attempted to reinstall the software, this time \nselecting a smaller amount of software to install. when the installation was \nfinished, i logged on to the machine and started practising linux.\n               comp8851/comp8860 industry based internship 3 june 2022 \nthe task for the upcoming week\nin the following week, we are set out to learn more about built-in commands \nand a few add-on linux monitoring tools for linux server performance. and \nmore on linux command shell, unix and linux file commands, and \npowershell is going to be introduced.\nweek 8 \ngoals, activities and outcomes\nthe activities in week 8 were mostly around getting a better understanding of \nlinux commands, linux monitoring tools, linux command shell, unix and \nlinux file commands, and powershell. the aim this week was to understand \nthe linux command shell and some of its basic utilities like navigating the \nlinux filesystem. also, powershell was introduced.\nnew knowledge, skills and experience \ni learnt some of the most fundamental commands important for system \nanalysis and debugging linux server issues like netstat for linux network and \nstatistics monitoring tool  where this command displays network connections, \nrouting tables, interface statistics and other commands to get real time \nnetwork statistics on linux. i also familiarised myself with powershell scripting \nenvironment and really enjoyed learning how to create a script in powershell.\nrewarding experience \nbeing able to learn linux with so much guidance and peers support made my \nlearning really effective. i got to have a lot of hands-on experience at the \npractice labs which made me feel very confident about my skills.\ndifficult experience \nworking with linux monitoring tools like netstat and iptraf to get various \ninformation on network statistics was challenging at first. understanding the \nbasis of powershell scripting environment took me some time to grasp but \noverall i had a very productive and fun week trying to learn all the concepts \nwell.\n               comp8851/comp8860 industry based internship 3 june 2022 \nthe task for the upcoming week\nin the next week, we are to locate battle room 11 for system security \nanalyst which is focused on tasks for system security analyst and where we \nwill be given trials in reconnaissance, domain administration, policy, log \ncollection and system analysis. \nweek 9 \ngoals, activities and outcomes\nin week 9, we entered battle room 11 for system security analyst which is \nfocused on tasks for system security analyst and where we were given trials \nin reconnaissance, domain administration, policy, log collection and system \nanalysis. in the battle room, we learnt individual skills and complete tasks, \naccording to different work roles. \nnew knowledge, skills and experience \nwe were provided with a list of objectives for this battle room and in order to \ncomplete these objectives we had to open the virtual desktop displaying the \nprograms we were going to use for these tasks. there were scripts from \npowershell that we had to use to achieve some outcomes which gave a \nstronger understanding of powershell and other linux monitoring tools.\nrewarding experience \nafter the last week, where i had struggled with understanding some linux \ncommands and powershell scripting environment, this week, the battle room \ntasks really helped me gain better understanding of these concepts in \npractical world. my peers and professionals were very supportive and \nencouraged me to complete tasks which made my experience very \nrewarding.\ndifficult experience \nas these were individual tasks, there were times when i felt stuck and \ncouldn’t further work through the given problem. for example, i found the \ntasks related to system analysis a bit challenging but constant guidance from \nprofessionals ensured that i succeed in achieving the given objectives.\n               comp8851/comp8860 industry based internship 3 june 2022 \nthe task for the upcoming week\nin the upcoming week, we are going to use putty to access the kali linux \nsystem where we are going to the battle room 11 window and secure the \nkali linux ip address. the set up and configuration of putty will equip us to \nperform all battle room 11 tasks for the kali linux system. \nweek 10 \ngoals, activities and outcomes \nin this week, the undertaking task was to install and configure putty (an \nemulator) to access the kali linux system set up in the battle room. the \ntask enabled me to understand the configuration process which has its usage \nin many software installations while working in an organisation at a \nprofessional level. the associated goal of the week was to understand the \nworking of linux operating system and ip addresses in an emulator \nenvironment to develop skills that can be utilised in other software \ninstallations. \nnew knowledge, skills and experience \nthis week was a new learning experience in terms of understanding the \nworkings of an emulator mobile application and ensuring its connectivity with \nthe linux network protocols. the new breadth of knowledge area was a \nstimulating experience to learn about ip addresses, their semantics and \npractical implementation on a software. it was a stepping-stone to gain new \nskills and enhance on previous network knowledge to learn more about \nprotocols, ports, telnet and graphical terminal program. in my personal \nexperience, it was necessary to understand the concepts of networks and \nrelate them to my professional career and job responsibilities. \nrewarding experience \nthe above discussed new learnings increased my interest in the networks \ndomain and made me eager to further strengthen the concepts of network \nand practical execution. the week presented an enriching experience to find \nout about other softwares associated with linux os and its configuration and \nan actual setup of a terminal program. \ndifficult experience \nsince terminal program was a new tool to use, i was sceptical about the \nimplementation as it did not pique my interest from a cybersecurity \nperspective. after understanding the wide functionalities that they offer within \n               comp8851/comp8860 industry based internship 3 june 2022 \nthe linux environment, it encouraged me to take this new challenge as a \ngrowth opportunity to learn things of wider scope and a little different from my \nmain interest.\nthe task for the upcoming week \nin the coming week, there is further study of the command line interface and \naddressing the commands that can be used to perform the tasks of the battle \nroom. \nweek 11 \ngoals, activities and outcomes \nduring this week, the main objective was to understand and learn to use the \ncommand line interface that was setup in the previous week. the different \ncommands to run directories and files within the system were to be \ndiscovered and credentials were set up to run sessions. it helped me to \nunderstand and get a grasp of the command line interface of putty and its \nsubsequent functionalities in the linux environment. \nnew knowledge, skills and experience \nthis week presented a learning curve in terms of understanding the syntax of \nthe commands that were used in the command line interface. i was able to \nunderstand how to access, modify and remove files or directories of the \nsystem. it came to my knowledge that command lines can achieve immediate \nresults within a computer system. this skill would be useful when i am \nworking within networks and protocols to attain prompt data from the system \nwithout hindering the actual structure of the data files. \nrewarding experience \nwhen i was able to run successful commands to extract files of the system \nand perform the tasks outlined, it was a great achievement. the experience \nenhanced my interest to learn and try more commands and recognise the use \nof command line interface in the optimum way possible for tasks that can be \nautomated. \ndifficult experience \nthe earlier challenge of understanding terminal interfaces in more detail was \npresent. it took some time to get hands on with the interface and grasp the \nconcept of running commands for tasks. trying to correct the erroneous \ncommands while running them seemed a difficult process initially but with \n               comp8851/comp8860 industry based internship 3 june 2022 \nconsistency and perseverance i was able to apprehend the use of right \ncommands. \nthe task for the upcoming week \nin the subsequent week, icmp protocol and its implementation in kali linux \nsystem is addressed to understand the operational information of the internet \nsuite.\nweek 12 \ngoals, activities and outcomes\nthe activities in week 12 were mostly around getting a better understanding \nof icmp protocol, what is it used for, its functioning and performing tasks that \nwere assigned to us using kali linux. the aim of this week was to understand \nthis protocol and some of its basic utilities like navigating the error in the \nnetwork and  understanding how it can be used dos attacks filesystem. \nalso, how it can be used for error reporting.\nnew knowledge, skills and experience \nwe were provided with a list of objectives for this protocol in the battle room \nand in order to complete these objectives we had to open the virtual desktop \ndisplaying the programs we were going to use for these tasks. there were \nscripts from powershell that we had to use to achieve some outcomes which \ngave a stronger understanding of how error are reported using icmp and \nrouting of the messages.\nrewarding experience \nbeing able to learn network protocol with so much guidance and peers \nsupport made my learning really effective. i got to have a lot of hands-on \nexperience at the practice labs which made me feel very confident about my \nskills.\ndifficult experience \nas these were individual tasks, there were times when i felt stuck and \ncouldn’t further work through the given problem. for example, i found the \n               comp8851/comp8860 industry based internship 3 june 2022 \ntasks related to system analysis a bit challenging but constant guidance from \nprofessionals ensured that i succeed in achieving the given objectives.\nthe task for the upcoming week\nthe upcoming week is my last week of internship at itic pvt ltd. in the last \nweek, i will be performing my remaining tasks that were assigned to me in the \nbattle room 11 and will start with the final internship report. the report will  \ninclude all the task completed during 6 months.\nweek 13 \ngoals, activities and outcomes\nthe main task for this week is to complete the final part of the training and \nstart with the final internship report. this report includes all the task \ncompleted till now and is basically a summary of the internship. \nnew knowledge, skills and experience \nwe were provided with a list of objectives for the battle room and in order to \ncomplete these objectives we had to open the virtual desktop displaying the \nprograms we were going to use for these tasks. there were scripts that we \nhad to use to achieve some outcomes which gave a stronger understanding \nof security concepts.\nrewarding experience \ni had a great learning experience. being able to gain so much knowledge \nabout things i have always been so fascinated by, makes me really grateful \nfor this experience. \n",
