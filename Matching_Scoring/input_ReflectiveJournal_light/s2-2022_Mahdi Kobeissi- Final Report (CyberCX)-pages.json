    "text": "week 7  \ngoals, activities and outcomes: \nmy main priority is to successfully complete the cyber fundamentals academy programme \nand the training for vulnerability management solution tools. this week's objective for me as \nan intern at cybercx is to attend all of the meetings that are scheduled for me, as well as to \nsuccessfully complete all of the duties mentioned on the timesheets that my team members \nmade when i started my position. soc challenge by cyber defenders and several \ndaily/weekly meetings with cybercx supervisors are some of the activities planned for this \nweek. splunk use knowledge gained through lab instruction, a cyber education training \nsession, and a review of the azure la outage were some of the results from this week. the \nboss of the soc challenge's cyber defender was our first assignment that week. the exercise \nbasically resembled a capture-the-flag game where we had to use the splunk course material. \nwe also attended a meeting in the academy regarding the masterclass on presentation skills, \nin which we essentially learned how to make a polished presentation to a client. by the end of \nthe week, a meeting was set up with a managing consultant to discuss consulting with the \nsnc privately (strategy and consulting). jakub, the programme manager, and i also \nreviewed and provided input on all of our training sessions, meetings, and courses over the \nprevious two weeks. \nnew knowledge, skills, and experiences: \nunderstanding splunk, producing good information security content, attending a consulting \n101 meeting, and reporting business goals, team goals, customer goals, and individual goals \nare some of the new things i learnt this week. i got to take part in \"catch the flag,\" where you \nm a h d i  k o b e i s s i -  4 5 8 8 9 6 8 6  \n \n \np a g e  19 | 36 \n \nare given a problem and must search for the solution on the splunk platform. it was \nfascinating and entertaining to finish. \nrewarding experience: \ncapture the flag with my team members was incredibly satisfying and exciting for me since i \ncould see the relationships growing and we were thinking more critically and logically \nbecause it was a team activity. \ndifficult experience: \nas a new intern, i felt like i had a tonne of work to get done during the day and that i should \nfinish it as soon as possible. this made it difficult for me to plan my lunch break time with \nmy schedule this week, which led to my second challenging experience, which was trying to \nfocus at the end of the day. so, that was a lesson well-learned. \nsuggestions or feedbacks that i would like improved in the workplace: \nthe soft skills, such as communication, language, and behaviour, are something i would like \nto develop at work. i have the impression that everyone at the company takes themselves way \ntoo seriously and that some people don't really put up a friendly front; they just want to do \ntheir task and leave. nevertheless, i think it's crucial to build a good rapport and bond with \nco-workers. \ntasks for the upcoming week: \nsome duties and tasks to be completed next week include: \n- \ntenable training \n- \ntenable sessions \n- \nitil mss training (break, fix vs security incidents, and incident management \nprocess) \n \n \nm a h d i  k o b e i s s i -

 4 5 8 8 9 6 8 6  \n \n \np a g e  21 | 36 \n \nmanaged to get mine. i mentioned this to my colleague emma, though, and she gave me \nadvice on how to deal with the situation. \nsuggestions or feedbacks that i would like improved in the workplace: \nthe time management in the office may be something i would really like to improve, and i \nwould really like us to have more access to online learning resources. \ntasks for the upcoming week: \nsome of the tasks that have been lined up for me in the upcoming week include things such \nas: \n- \nessentials 8 session \n- \n1-1 session with the team leader to follow up on boarding with the clients \n- \nmicrosoft security compliance and identity fundamentals sc-900 \n- \nintroduction to service now  \n- \nintroduction to wire shark/ nmap \n- \nanalysis of a threat intel report  \n- \nend of month reporting  \n \nweek 9 \ngoals, activities and outcomes: \nsince ms sentinel is the client's primary goal, i want to concentrate on it this week. this \nweek i will be conducting an end of month report and giving it to the team leader. i will \nalso be introduced to two new courses including an introduction to service now, which is a \ntool used in the company, and an introduction to wire shark/ nmap. i will also be \ncompleting a microsoft security compliance and identity fundamental sc-900 course \nfollowed by an essentials 8 session. to end the week off, i will be having a 1-1 session with \nthe team leader to follow up on the on boarding of the clients.  \n \nm a h d i  k o b e i s s i -  4 5 8 8 9 6 8 6  \n \n \np a g e  22 | 36 \n \nnew knowledge, skills, and experiences: \nthis week i was insighted on a lot of new knowledges and experiences mostly from the \nmicrosoft course that i had completed earlier in the week. i have successfully completed an \nend of month report and presented it to the team leader who was satisfied of my work. i \nendured a lot of information from the introductory courses and the microsoft course that was \nrequired from me to complete according to my spreadsheet.  \nrewarding experience: \nthe fact that emma takes time out of her day to meet with me and teach me new things while \nalso helping me comprehend topics that need clarification is why i really appreciate our \nshadow sessions. \ndifficult experience: \nthankfully, this week i didn’t feel like i experienced anything difficult. although if i were to \nexperience any difficulty during my time at cybercx, i would find ways to try and relieve \nmy stress such as relieving pressure through exercise, or get engaged in social events to try \nand feel better, or spend some time with family and friends, and most importantly i would \ntalk to someone on the team about it so i can get an insight on what i should do in this \ncircumstance or what they would recommended me do for next time.  \nsuggestions or feedbacks that i would like improved in the workplace: \nsome aspects of my job that i would like to improve are everyone dining together at lunch \nand starting discussions to get to know my co-workers much better since i think that will help \nus all get to know each other and form good relationships in the office, especially after a \nscary time like covid-19 \n \nm a h d i  k o b e i s s i -  4 5 8 8 9 6 8 6  \n \n \np a g e  23 | 36 \n \ntasks for the upcoming week: \nsome of the duties that i will accomplish next week include: \n- \nweekly meetings with the team \n- \nstarting with chris sanders- investigation theory course \n \nweek 10 \ngoals, activities and outcomes: \na meeting with the nsw soc-sentinel session, discussions on liquid files and how to \ndistribute and manage meta data with a senior consultant, the weekly cybercx meeting, \njorge's splunk demo, a business writing course, chris sanders investigation theory course \nand virtual labs are among the events happening this week. \nnew knowledge, skills, and experiences: \nit was really interesting this week in understanding the chris sanders investigation theory \ncourse and as well as the virtual labs. our team had a broad discussion with a senior \nconsultant relation to liquid files and how to distribute and manage the meta data.  \nrewarding experience: \nthis week, it was satisfying to know that i had written a business report effectively, and once \nthe programme manager saw it, he was impressed by how effective and efficient my business \nwriting skills were. this is all because to my colleague emma, who greatly assisted me. \ndifficult experience: \nthis week was pretty challenging for me, the reason being is that i have not been getting \nalong with one of the senior analysts in my pod, and it really affected me that i was \nconsidering changing pods because of this reason. i enjoy working with cybercx and it is \nnormal to have lots of ups in your workplace, at the same time it is normal to go through \nm a h d i  k o b e i s s i -  4 5 8 8 9 6 8 6  \n \n \np a g e  24 | 36 \n \nsome downfalls with some of your colleagues. i had stepped this up and taken it to the team \nleader who then gave me his word on trusting him to talk with the senior analyst without \ncausing any more tension, and he did exactly according to his word.  \nsuggestions or feedbacks that i would like improved in the workplace: \ni think it would be very good if we could connect with the managers more and learn from \nthem at work, therefore that is something i would like to alter. \ntasks for the upcoming week: \nsome of the tasks that are required for the upcoming week include things such as: \n- \ndaily standup meeting  \n- \nweekly standup meeting   \n- \n1-1 with team lead \n- \n1-1 with soc manager \n- \nit incident scenario  \n- \noperational technology presentation  \n- \nsleep and our health: mental health awareness series \n- \nprofessional headshot session \n \nweek 11 \ngoals, activities and outcomes: \nmy objective for the following week is to begin developing the siem tool exabeam for \nprioritising alerts. my primary objective for week 11 remains to increase my knowledge in \nthe area of cybersecurity. i truly want to expand my knowledge so that i can someday work \nas a senior analyst. \n \n \nm a h d i  k o b e i s s i -  4 5 8 8 9 6 8 6  \n \n \np a g e  25 | 36 \n \nnew knowledge, skills, and experiences: \nthis week was quiet interesting, i didn’t feel like i learnt anything new relating to the cyber \nfield, although i did learn a few different things relating to mental health awareness series and \nhow sleep can affect our health in a positive way.  \nrewarding experience: \nthis week, my 1-1 session with the team leader was spoken over on a quick game of 8 ball \npool table. our office has a beautiful setting which allows you to gain a type of closeness \nwith your colleagues over a game room that is set up to take your mind off things if needed \nand to also build a relationship whether it was with your leaders, colleagues or even clients. \nthis really helped get the roughness off things especially after what happened to me last \nweek with the senior analyst, which we kind of brushed over too. \ndifficult experience: \ni am finding it really difficult when my team members or work colleagues from the same pod \nare working from home while myself along with a few others are in the office. this is \nbecause we are trying to build a positive relationship with others and learn from each other, \nas well as finish the assigned tasks from us and it is difficult when half the team is working \nfrom home while the other half has shown up in the office. \nsuggestions or feedbacks that i would like improved in the workplace: \nsomething i really hope for the future is that everyone slowly begins working back from the \noffices rather than working from home. i really enjoy coming into work everyday and \nmeeting with new people having conversations with my work colleagues rather than just \ntalking to a screen while sitting at home. \n \nm a h d i  k o b e i s s i -  4 5 8 8 9 6 8 6  \n \n \np a g e  26 | 36 \n \ntasks for the upcoming week: \nsome of the tasks that are required from me according to the spread sheet and according to \nwhere i have left off it:  \n- \nget access to servicenow  \n- \nattend daily/weekly meetings  \n- \nbegin working on the exabeam tool \n \nweek 12 \ngoals, activities and outcomes: \nsome of the activities that have been laid out for me to work on include: \n- \ndaily standup \n- \nweekly soc meeting \n- \nconsulting presentation \n- \nteam lunch \n- \ndealing with technology stress | mental health awareness series \n- \n3 year anniversary update with ceo \n- \nsecposium talk session: cyber intelligence team \n- \ndiwali celebration  \n- \n1-1 talk with the team lead \n \nnew knowledge, skills, and experiences: \nwhen i first looked at my schedule i knew this week was going to be filled with new and \nexciting things to learn and experience whether it was attend the weekly meetings, or listen to \npresentations or different talk sessions, i knew i would talk a lot out of this week and i was \nright. i learnt a lot about the cyber intelligence team, i continued the mental health awareness \nseries that i began from last week, the consulting presentation was very informative and full \nof laughter as well which i was really happy about. \n \nm a h d i  k o b e i s s i -  4 5 8 8 9 6 8 6  \n \n \np a g e  27 | 36 \n \nrewarding experience: \nwhat i was particularly happy about was that the while team went out for lunch together and \nwhen we sat down at the restaurant, we all kind of put work topics and information aside and \njust had a laugh with the team while enjoying a delicious meal. we began talking about our \npersonal lives and what most of the colleagues were doing before they began working in \ncyber security or working for cybercx and i was surprised to say the least that some of my \nwork colleagues didn’t seem like they had worked the types of job they had said they did. it \nwas a really enjoyable hour.    \ndifficult experience: \nthankfully, i didn't feel like i went through anything challenging this week. however, if i \nwere to run into any problems while i was working at cybercx, i would try to find ways to \nreduce my stress, such as working out to relieve pressure, participating in social activities to \ntry and feel better, or spending time with family and friends. most importantly, though, i \nwould talk to someone on the team about it so i could get their advice on what i should do in \nthis situation or what they would advise me to do for the next time. \nsuggestions or feedbacks that i would like improved in the workplace: \nsomething i would like to suggest to my workplace is that we have these types of lunches \nmore often because i felt like not only did it relieve the stress and pressure off some of the \nwork colleagues it also began building a closer connection with each other and allowed us to \nunderstand each other abit better and what everyone done outside of work etc.  \n \n \n \n",
