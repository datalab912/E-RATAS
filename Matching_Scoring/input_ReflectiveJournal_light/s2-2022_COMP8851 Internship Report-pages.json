    "text": "week 1 \nmy first day of the internship i found to be slightly frustrating. having to work from home to begin \nwith was not an ideal way to be properly immersed in the workplace and to understand how the \ncompany and its workers operate. however, i understand why the company is mostly working \nremotely and i do see the benefits of working from home. i am grateful that i will soon have a day in \nthe office to get that in-person experience. the first day was slightly frustrating also due to the \nlimited amount of work i was able to do. the process of onboarding me to their systems took time \nso until that was done, i could not begin the project. in the meantime, i was able to go over the code \ni would be working initially with to understand how their work is structured, to see which parts i was \ncomfortable with already and which parts was new to me. \nthe second day was very informative. my supervisor sai and i had a very long video call through \nmicrosoft teams where he explained, in detail, what my role and tasks will be for the internship \nwhile also providing explanations of other departments in the company. this way i was able to have \nbetter context and understanding as to where my role fits in the day-to-day operations, and an idea \nas to how my roles may grow over the course of the internship depending on my level of progress. \nthe third day involved me creating the daily report and summary report for today after pulling \nrecent changes from the github repository we used and running pieces of code to download the \nrequired files. i then looked through the daily report, determining which images of documents had \nproduced a confidence level of less than 90%. i then had to visually inspect those images then, for \neach, record which fields appear are most effected and why. after that, i pushed to the github \nrepository the reports i created. to end the day, i was asked to join a relaxed and fun team meeting \non teams where i was able to introduce myself and get an idea of what these weekly meetings will \nbe like. prior to this, i had only been in contact with two people from truuth, ceo mike simpson and \nsai, so i had little idea as to who else worked for the company and what their personalities were like. \nthe team meeting helped to less the somewhat isolating feeling of working from home on my own. \n \nweek 2 \ni began the week by again creating the daily reports and inspecting images which produced low \nconfidence levels. next, i was able to move on to refining and testing code that would restructure \nand better organise documents going into the onedrive structure each day. at the time, photos \nwould all be dumped into the one folder in the onedrive, so all different document types were \nmixed together.  \nthe plan was to write a python script that would create nested folders in the form of document type \n(e.g. drivers licence, passport), then inside that, country the document is from, and inside that, the \nspecific document template (e.g. nsw full licence, qld learners licence). then by taking the name \nof the image in the form of a trace id, it can be matched up with information in a corresponding \nexcel file which has all the attributes of each image, including trace id, document type, country, etc. \nonce that information is extracted, the image can be sent to correct folder in the onedrive. this \ntook a few hours with quite a lot of debugging to complete but it was satisfying to see the finished \nresult and to know i had again contributed to the team. sai was always just a call or message away \non teams when i was stuck and needed help.  \nthe next task i had to complete this week was categorizing existing documents in the onedrive into \nthe defined structure. as images of documents would tend to come in pairs (one photo for the front \nof the document and one photo for the back), they would have the same trace id in the name but \nthen followed by “-1” or “-2” , i first needed to write code that would create folders for each of the \nunique documents and then copy the images for that document, whether it be one or two images, \ninto the respective folder. after that i needed a line that would then delete the original images. the \nimages all followed the same naming convention but there were some that would have an additional \nspace so i had clean that and also account for photos that weren’t in a pair in which case the name \nwould be just the trace id.  \ni tested the code extensively on a test folder on my local drive instead of the onedrive to ensure it \nwould work first and not ruin the old structure or delete photos. once i believed the code to work \ncompletely on my drive, i was given the all-clear by sai to run it for the onedrive. i was meant to \nleave out the line of code that would delete the original images, but i made the mistake of including \nit. as there were thousands of images, the code was running for a long time but during that process i \nnoticed that only one of the images in the pairs were being moved into their respective folders and \nthe other images seemed to be deleted. i alerted sai and he had me abort the code. at this point, i \nwas very stressed and worried i had permanently removed a large amount of their data. thankfully, \nsai still able to access the images from his end, even the ones that appeared deleted on my end, so \nhe was able to create of copy of them before we attempted to diagnose what happened. for the rest \nof the week, the code would be tested without deleting original images.   \nonce images were placed in folders based on their trace id, i then needed to run a classification api \npython script that would loop through the names of each of the folders then use those names to \nextract the classification information given to the corresponding document located in the aws \nenvironment. this information would come in the form of a json file and would contain a variety of \ninformation, but the goal was to extract just the trace id, country code and document type. this \ndata would then be made into an excel file to be uploaded into the same onedrive location. i was \nable to get the code to work on a test directory i had made in the onedrive with a small selection of \nthe documents, but i could not yet implement it on the full drive as it was experiencing syncing \nissues due to the mistake i had made earlier.  i was frustrated that my mistake was still hindering my \nprogress and that of the company. \noverall, this was a frustrating, stressful, and exhausting week but it was still a valuable learning \nexperience. it is normal for there to be times like these during one’s career so now is as good a time \nas ever to go through these hardships to know how to handle them and move forward. \n \nweek 3 \nto start the week, i was informed by sai that some of the work i had begun working on the previous \nweek had been passed on to someone else to be completed. understandably, as i am on only three \ndays a week instead of full time, tasks i work on will take longer to be completed so it makes sense \nthat they will sometimes need to be handed off to someone else so they can be completed in a \ntimely manner. at the same time however, it can feel like they were passed on because i was not \nskilled enough to complete the tasks correctly or as fast as they expected.  \ndaily reports were made without issue for the first day, but two days later when i had my next day \nin, i discovered some complications with making the reports for that day and the prior day. i found \nthat some images were not classified as any document type so instead had a null value. this \nsituation was not considered so i had to adjust the code so that if an image had a null value for \ndocument type, then the null will be filled with ‘failedtransactions’. from this, i added these failed \ntransactions into the reports to indicate how many failed each day. i would then visually inspect \neach of these failed images like i do for all the images that produce a confidence level of less than \n90% to see why it was not classified then record my findings. after feeling like i had not \naccomplished much to start the week, i was pleased that i was able to discover these errors and \nrectify them. half of a day was spent solely on fixing and making the reports for two days instead of \njust one and visually inspecting each of the low confidence images, but it still felt productive.  \nboth the first and second day included hour long meetings with sai, soham sarfare (another truuth \nteam member) and two other interns from macquarie university, sheya john and yan yu. in these \nmeetings, soham and sai walked us through the process of testing the primary and secondary \nclassifiers for new documents beings added so we could then attempt it ourselves on documents for \ncountries yet to be added. i was assigned just a single document from switzerland as sai only wanted \nme to get a better understanding of the process in order to help me understand why documents \nproduced low confidence levels each day. i was able to complete my primary classifier tests on the \nswiss drivers license to end the second day and then the following morning i completed the \nsecondary classifier and extractor.  \nto end the week, sai assigned me the task of going through the document which has all the images \nof documents that produced low confidence levels and their issues, then classifying each into one of \neight generalized error categories. a time-consuming task but the aim is to be able to improve \nreadability for stakeholders when reporting why issues are occurring and how they can be fixed. \nthe first half of this week was quite rough in terms of confidence in my abilities and the level of \nstress i felt but the second half was a lot more positive and felt very productive. my outlook on the \nrest of the internship has also improved as a result. \n \n \n \nweek 4 \nthe week began with sai and i having a video meeting with mike. the purpose of the meeting was to \ngo over the current state of the project and our plans for the week ahead. he noted the issues that \nare present in terms of the summary reports being generated in terms of certain plots being \nessentially unreadable due to how much data has been collected at this point and will continue to \ngrow. he suggested ways to improve it while also asking for our ideas, so it really felt like a team \neffort. sai then explained our plan to go select the images belonging to one of the eight generalized \nerror categories established last week, in particular the category of images that represent errors \ncaused by document templates, then investigate how we can rectify those errors going forward. in a \nweek’s time we will present our progress to mike in another meeting. \nafter the meeting, i was tasked with generating the reports not just for that day but also the three \nprevious days, as well as inspect the low confidence images for each, as sai was unable to. this \nprocess alone was quite tedious and took up half of the day, so it was a bit dejecting not being able \nto work on the tasks discussed in the meeting. to end the day, sai tasked with me updating the code \nwhich uploads the daily photos to the onedrive as the new organised structured had been \nimplemented. this task was time consuming as there was quite a bit of debugging involved but i was \nable to complete without too much hassle.  \nmy next day in i first tested the code for uploading to the onedrive on that day’s batch of images. \nthe code worked and so images were sent into their correct sub-folders. after the daily report \nmaking and error identifying, i was tasked with creating a new report, like the daily and summary \nanalysis reports in jupyter, but for the images errors that have accumulated. as i spent time in the \nprevious week categorizing all the images with issues into one of eight error categories, i was able to \ntransfer that data into an excel sheet then import it into the notebook. from here i began making \ntables and waterfall charts to show how many errors are occurring for categories such as document \ntemplate, australian state, day and for each error type. this report will be used to then establish \nwhich documents require the most immediate work and why. \nthis week was a shorter week as my usual third day working with truuth is a friday but for this week \ni was moving residences on the friday. i informed sai at the start of the week that this was \nhappening and apologised for any inconvenience caused. somewhat fortunately, sai too was going \nto be out the same day, so i felt a little less guilty about the time lost. \n \nweek 5 \ngroup called sai and mike to kick off the week, recapping what sai and i worked on for the days we \nhad the previous week and explaining what our plan was for this week. mike gave us his feedback \nand suggestions for how we can improve our work, in particular, the errors identified report i had \nbegun producing. he was pleased with the work i have been doing but also gave valuable feedback \nfor what i can do better. i expressed my concerns with speed of progress due to having to do the \ndaily reports for all the days i’m not in, which for this first day of this week, i had to complete five \ndays of daily reports to catch up. both mike and sai understood my perspective which i appreciated. \nsai told me he would attempt to get back into the rhythm of completing daily reports for days i’m \nnot in which would help greatly. the rest of the first day was spent, first, making the five days of \nreports and error records, then, improving the errors identified report until a point that both sai and \ni were happy to begin present to mike for feedback. it was a satisfying end to this day, and i was \nproud of what i had produced for the team. \nanother call with sai and mike took place early on the second day to present mike the errors \nidentified report that was produced to show which document templates require the most \nimmediate work. mike gave reasonable criticism and described what information is most vital to add \nto the report and i felt confident i could make those changes to present again at the end of the \nweek. the decision was made to combine the summary report and the errors report into one as they \nboth attempt to show the reader similar information in terms of service performance across the \ndifferent document types across time. i was pleased to know that sai was able to complete the daily \nreports and error checks on the day between my first day this week and this day. after performing \nthe regular daily report and error check tasks i then spent the rest of the day working on this revised \nsummary/errors report. \nthe final day for the week was spent almost entirely on improving the combined report and trying \ndifferent methods of adding extra information that mike wanted to have included. this time allowed \nme to further develop my python and report making skills which i believe to be valuable for future \nwork and employment opportunities. in the afternoon, i had another call with sai and mike to \npresent what i have produced so far and could show now how average confidence levels for each \ntype of document has changed over time and which particular fields on a document are causing the \nmost issues overall and more so for the past week. mike was pleased with what i had made as it was \nable to show the information he was after. to end the day, sai and i called to go deeper into the \ninformation i had produced to decide which six or seven document types to focus on investigating \ntheir respective issues to be fixed next week. although we didn’t achieve the goal that was \nestablished for this week of to start trying to fix the issues in the most problematic document types, \nit was still a productive and useful week developing this new combined report which will help us \nachieve that initial goal next week in a more effective manner. \n \nweek 6 \nthe week began with a call with mike where sai and i presented the document templates we have \nchosen to attempt to fix. sai outlined the method we will use and how we will create a notebook for \neach of the documents types we try to fix which will show whether the confidence levels improve \nover time from when we implement the fixes. sai suggested i comb through the west australian full \ndrivers licences that have produced errors, in particular those which appear to be an issue on our \nend as opposed to a user error. i spent most of the day performing this after i completed the daily \nreport and error check processes. i found great success making slight adjustments to the template to \nfix almost all of the images that were classified as having template errors which sai commended me \non. it was a satisfying feeling. there were some images that sai and i struggled to find the cause of \ncertain fields on the document not being read correctly so deeper investigations need to be made in \nthe future.  \nthe second day of the week was spent polishing the summary/errors notebook and the notebook i \nhad created for wa full drivers licences by adding more helpful pieces of information and removing \nunnecessary ones, with regular feedback and suggestions from sai. towards the end of the day we \ndiscussed the final layout of the summary/errors report to be presented to mike the following day \nthen he suggested i then move on to investigating new zealand drivers licence errors like i had for \nwa ones while he adds final touches to the report structure. another productive day where i believe \nsai and i showed good teamwork and communication with a clear goal in mind. \nthe last day of the week first involved me beginning to investigate the errors with the two new \nzealand full drivers licence templates with the hope a notebook could be presented to mike along \nwith the wa and qld ones. these were much more difficult to resolve than the wa ones, so i was \nunable to make much progress before the call with sai and mike in the late morning. this was \nfrustrating as it felt like progress was once again stunted and lacking. a lengthy call was then had, \npresenting what sai and i had accomplished so far to mike. he was pleased with what have done in \nterms of resolving errors. he did however have suggestions to improve how we report and visualise \nthe improvements we have mad. i was also able to make suggestions of my own which mike seemed \nreceptive of. the afternoon was then spent making the daily reports and error recordings before \nthen moving back to investigating the recent wa full drivers licences errors that were still occurring \nand then the nz licences.  \nthis week provided mixed feelings. at times i did feel very productive, and i was happy with the \nprogress being made, but then there were other times where it felt like more issues were being \nadded faster than we could fix which can feel a bit overwhelming. i’ll admit i am looking forward to \ngetting through next week to the mid-semester break as the balance between this internship three \ndays a week, my part-time job three days a week, and moving houses in the middle of that has been \nquite taxing. however, i am excited to see the finished results at the end of the internship and \nconfident i can truly contribute to the team until then. \n \nweek 7 \na call with sai and mike to kick off the final week before the mid-term break contained some \nnegative feedback from mike. he was disappointed with how few document templates we were able \nto fix errors for in the last week. sai and i were able to explain why we had encountered issues which \nslowed our progress, including only being able to spread our manpower so far between the two of \nus and me not having the abilities or access to resolve a number of errors. we outlined our plan for \nme to work on nsw full drivers licences and to also create a script that will take a document \ntemplate that we have provided fixes for and run all its error documents plus a sample of successful \ndocuments through the template to collect confidence levels and compare them from the those \nrecorded prior to the fixes to determine the effectiveness of what we have changed. after creating \nthe daily reports and identified the day’s errors, i then spent the rest of the day working on these \ntwo tasks. i encountered several issues with the code that required sai’s help but had made \nsignificant progress. by the end of the day, i had also begun to work through providing any fixes i \ncould for the nsw licences. \nfor the second day, i continued working on the script to test on wa full drivers licences after doing \nthe daily reports and errors tasks for the day i was not present as sai was unable to. eventually, i was \nable to complete the script and collect confidence levels for error documents as well as a sample of \nhigh confidence documents from the template and then create boxplots and line plots comparing \nthe confidence levels before and after my error fixes were implemented. unfortunately, there were \nstill quite a lot of unresolved errors that i struggled to figure out a solution for which was worrying \nand disheartening. i was able to finish my attempt at fixing the errors found in the nsw full drivers \nlicences with moderate success. a lot of the errors were due to images being too blurry so there was \nlittle i could do to extract correct text from those. it does not currently seem possible to improve the \naverage confidence levels of these templates to above 90% which was disappointing as mike had \nhigher expectations that we can’t seem to meet. \nprior to the regular friday call with mike and sai to recap what was done in the past week, i was able \nto run the script for qld full drivers licences and create the same plots that was done for wa. mike \nwas happy with how we collected the data and how i visualised it. despite not achieving the \nimproved confidence levels he was after, he was still pleased that we have been able to establish the \nsteps we need to do next to reach those levels based off the data we have collected and visualised. \nthis gave me a good confidence boost heading into the mid-term break. the rest of the day was \nspent running the script on other templates that sai and i had attempted to fix and completing the \ndaily reports and error checks. \n \nweek 8 \nto recap what happened in the two weeks i was away for the mid-semester break and to decide \nwhat the next steps were, i took part in a long call with mike and sai. it seemed like little progress \nhad been made in my absence as sai was working on his own and had other tasks to complete. also, \nhe also had to take time off as he moved to india to work from there, so it was disappointing but \nunderstandable that not much had changed since i last worked. based off suggestion mike made in \nthe meeting, i made additions to the summary report to improve how we show which documents \nwe need to focus on fixing next by focusing on the more important fields on a document which bring \ndown overall confidence levels instead of all the fields. i felt happy with being able to produce what \nmike had in mind and i was confident he will like the results when they are presented at the end of \nthe week. following this, i was tasked with investigating sa full drivers licences in the same way i \ndid in previous weeks. \nthe second day of the week was spent investigating sa learners drivers licences and then tas full \ndrivers licences (as well as the regular daily reporting and error checking). the main focus is \ncurrently fixing as many document templates as we can and as soon as we can. however, the tas \ninvestigations took much longer than anticipated. it proved difficult to make changes that would fix \nan issue in one field on the document without it breaking another unrelated field. i found this to be \nvery frustrating as it felt like the day was almost a waste with very little progress made. i expressed \nto sai the issues i was facing. he appreciated my efforts and explained that there are bugs that may \nneed to be sorted that i cannot fix from my end. \nfor the final day of the week, i first tried to fix the tas learner drivers licences, but i ran into the \nsame issues i had with the full licences the previous day. after explaining the problems to sai, he \nsuggested i move onto error-prone documents from other states. i selected to work on the other \nwa drivers licences as i had already worked through the wa full drivers licences and knew what \nerrors to expect. fixing these documents proved to be much easier than the tas documents so i was \nhappy to actually make some meaningful improvements. as i was able to move through these \ndocuments fairly quickly, i was motivated to move onto another state. i selected the two templates \nfor nt and was able to investigate those errors too. this day was much more satisfying than the \nprevious one, and overall, the week was a good start to the second half of the internship. \n \nweek 9 \na lengthy call with mike and sai started the week to go over what sai and i accomplished last week \nand what we intend to do in the coming week. mike then gave his feedback and ideas for what he \nwould like us to do going forward. i was confident i could accomplish what he asked for in terms of \nimproving the way we select which documents to fix each week, and after the call i was able to \naccomplish the task and provided mike with a list of the ten documents i would focus on next which \nhe was happy with. for the rest of the day, after completing the daily reports and error checks, as \nwell as those for the previous four days i was not working, i worked on fixing the first couple \ndocuments on that list, two variations of sa drivers licences. \nthe morning for the second day was spent clarifying some minor details with sai and then he had me \njoin a call with two other interns. in this call, sai had me show and explain to the interns the initial \nsteps of the process i use on a daily basis for downloading and uploading data, generating the daily \nreports, performing error checks, and fixing document templates as they will be assisting me for the \nremainder of my internship. sai wished me to essentially act as a team leader for them going \nforward. this will help develop my communication, teamwork, and leadership skills. the afternoon \nwas then spent on investigating the act drivers licence errors. \nthe final day of the week included the end of week call with mike and sai where i presented the \nprogress made for the week. mike was pleased with the results, and the plan sai and i had for going \nforward in terms deciding which templates to work on, laying out what still needs fixing in templates \nwe have looked at and bringing in the other interns to help with the workload. the feedback filled \nme with confidence as well as the plan for future weeks as a worry of mine throughout the \ninternship was too much work being put on sai’s shoulders and my own. another positive note to \nend the week was my investigation and improvement of nsw and qld drivers licences. \n \nweek 10 \ni unfortunately missed the first day of the week due to being sick with a stomach bug. i informed sai \nearly that morning that i would not be able to work and why.  he was understanding and hoped i got \nwell soon which i appreciated. as the two interns were now introduced to some of the process of \nwhat i do, i was hopeful they could cover at least some of the work i would have done.  \nin the morning of the second day, i had a thorough call with the two interns to present the \ndocument fixing process to them. my presentation and leadership skills were able to be refined \nmore by regularly getting feedback from them at multiple points to also ensure they were \nunderstanding what i was presenting. at the end of the call, we established the steps going forward \nand how we would divide the workload. i was excited to see how well we would work together and \nthe how much more we can get done in the next few weeks. for the afternoon, i continued my \ninvestigation of qld heavy vehicle drivers licences which was difficult to fix. unexplainable bugs \nwith extract certain fields continued to appear despite trying various techniques, so it was a \nfrustrating time. after explaining to sai, he said he would give me a hand with it when he is next \nfree. during this, i answered any questions that the interns had in regard to their newly assigned \ntasks, which i was more than happy to answer. to end the day, i begin investigating all the \ndocuments that were misclassified due to truuth’s models and not due to user error. \ni continued this task to start the final day of the week until late in the morning when i called the two \ninterns. the goal of this call was to have one of the interns go through the process of creating the \ndaily reports and performing error checks with me watching to see if they can follow the process i \ntaught and provide any assistance. unfortunately, they both had issues setting up the proper file \nlocations from the git repository so i had to go through the process myself while sharing my screen \nso they could watch. they were still able to ask questions during it and the call was recorded so the \nplan is for one of them to actually try it on monday. for the afternoon, i was tasked with adding \nsections to the daily analysis and summary reports for a4 documents which are now being included. \nthese documents are primarily birth certificates. i was able to complete this without too much issue, \nso i then finished the day beginning my investigation philippines drivers licences. not a lot of \nprogress was made this week in terms of fixing documents due to various reasons. however, not \nbeing able to work due to sickness, and teaching the two interns were both unavoidable, with the \nlatter hopefully improving productivity going forward. \n \nweek 11 \nit felt as though not much progress was made and little was learned this week. to start the week, sai \nwas sick, so the other two interns and i were left to complete tasks on our own. however, the two \ninterns had issues syncing with the company’s onedrive and so they struggled to complete the daily \nreports and error check process on their own. as a result, i had to go through it with them again, \nresulting in three people doing a one-person job. for the rest of the day, they were attempting to \ninvestigate the same document i assigned them each last week with what seemed to be little results \ndue to those issues which i was unable to help fix with my limited knowledge of their onedrive \nsystem. regardless, i continued my own investigation of philippines drivers licences, and then qld \nphotocards and medicare cards. \ndue to me attending a wedding, i was unable to work on my second day of the week with truuth. i \ninformed sai in the previous week that it was occurring, and he was thankfully understanding. now \nthat the other interns are familiar with the work i do, i was confident they could cover for me given \nsai was well enough to help them out if they needed it. \nunfortunately, one of the interns made an error with the prior day’s error checks so we went \nthrough it together to ensure it was all done correctly. following this, i joined a call with sai and \nmike to present to mike what we’ve worked on in the last two weeks. he decided that sai and i now \nneed to focus on more backend issues that i previously have not been taught how to fix, such as \nmisclassifications. mike acknowledged that he is happy with the work i have done so far but that my \ntasks for the last few weeks have been repetitive and it was time for me to learn more and \ncontribute via more in-depth problems, which i was excited for. the afternoon was spent completing \nthe day’s summary reports and error checks, investigating errors with medicare documents, then \nupdating the qld drivers licences to now read the card number and testing the updated template on \na large sample of documents. the card number was read successfully on almost all images that \ndidn’t have any issues present. \n \nweek 12 \nthe penultimate week began with me recording the errors that occurred in the last three days as \nonly the reports were made for those days while i was not working. following that, i performed the \nusual daily report and error check tasks, then completed my investigation of medicare documents, \nmany of which i was not able to fix due to backend issues that were out of my control. for the \nafternoon, sai introduced me to image deblurring using deep learning methods that he and the team \nare attempting to implement. at the time they were stuck with having the code in amazon \nsagemaker not recognise the gpu they need to use so after a brief introduction, sai tasked me with \nattempting to find a solution. due to it all being new to me, he expected that i probably would not \nbe able fix it but we both agreed it was beneficial for me to learn about the software and how to use \nsagemaker. i attempted a few potential solutions i found online but with no success or further \ninsight into what could the cause which was a frustrating end to the day. \nsai and i intended to call in the morning of my second day this week, after completing the daily \nreports production and error checks, in order to go over what i attempted to fix the gpu recognition \nissue from the first day. unfortunately, sai informed me was very busy due to being given extra work \nso we were unable to call. instead, he messaged me asking to keep working at it and to try different \nthings, but i found myself still struggling to understand what i could do to help without extra \nassistance from him. the gpu issue did seem to be a somewhat common problem when researching \nonline, with different python package versions causing inconsistencies when combined, and with the \nonly promising solution requiring a whole extra package which seems to have been forgotten and \nrequires an nvidia developer account to access. i informed sai of this and he said he would look into \nit, but the day felt almost like a waste of time having spent the majority of it on this problem with \nessentially no progress.  \nthe morning of the final day of the week was spent giving a short presentation to the unit convenor \nabout my time with truuth and watching the presentations of the other interns in the unit. after \ncompleting my daily tasks, i joined a call with mike and sai where they gave their overall feedback \nfor my time with the company. they were both very happy with my performance and what i brought \nto the team which i was very thankful for. mike admitted that he would like to offer me a job but \ncannot do so due to current budget constraints which i was understanding of. however, he asked for \nme to stay in touch if those constraints lessen and an opportunity presents itself in the near future. i \nthanked them both for the opportunity and the feedback, and then left the call feeling both relieved \nand proud.     \n \nweek 13 \nsadly, my internship ended abruptly as on the saturday before this week i sustained an eye injury \nplaying local club cricket. a cricket ball hit my left eye at speed which resulted in a fractured eye \nsocket and scratched pupil and so i was required to allow my eye time to recover by resting in bed \nfor at least a week. the day after, i messaged sai to inform him of my injury and provided him with a \ndoctor’s certificate from the eye specialist i was sent to. i apologised for not being able to work and \nhe replied by wishing me a speedy recovery. he also let me know that when i am healthy, we will \nneed to have one last call to organise any handover over data and resources that may need to be \ndone. i replied by saying i will let him know as soon as i can call. obviously this was not how i wanted \nmy time with truuth to end but it at least happened at a point after my work had essentially been \ncompleted and i had received my feedback from sai and mike so there should be little disruption on \ntheir end. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n
