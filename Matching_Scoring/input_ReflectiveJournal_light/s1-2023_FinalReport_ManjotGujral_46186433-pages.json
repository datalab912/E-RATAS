    "text": "week 1: induction week (20th february 2023 – 26th february 2023)  \nthe internship was kicked off with an orientation program set up at the workplace. all the interns were \nasked to assemble at the office for a small introduction to the truuth team. the main intention of this \nprogram was to get to know the people we are going to work with for the next thirteen weeks. there \nwas a brief introductory session detailing the roles and responsibilities, and a unique one-page document \nwas presented to everyone in the team that outlines their expected deliverables. everyone was asked to \nreflect on their opinions on their target goals for smooth sailing forward. after the detailed informatory \nsession, there was a small team-building exercise designed to find a solution to the challenge of \nacquiring australian passport data for classifying and authenticating the passports. this data could help \nthe organization achieve a potential client.  \nthe whole group was divided into two teams, and the challenge was to come up with a secure, efficient, \nand foolproof way to capture one of each passport types available in all of australia. multiple ideas \nstemmed from both groups and after a thorough discussion both teams agreed on an idea which is to \ncreate a google form that can be shared initially with friends and family requesting them to upload their \npassports. the team also proposed to award people with a monetary benefit, so that it motivates people \nto submit more responses. the team also took the initiative to divide the work among themselves to \nfinish the job faster (passport index, n.d.).  \nthe task that was initially assigned to me was researching the available different types of passports. \nactively browsing on the internet led to some information gain on the topic, and i came across a very \ngood source index that had all the available information about passports and their different types. also, \nwe were using confluence to document our research and progress, where i created a page detailing the \nsummary of my research and its respective findings.  \ni felt that the whole truuth team was very interactive and made us feel welcome. they were considerate \nof our concerns and queries and answered them in detail. i also observed that the intern team is very \nactive and vocal about their ideas which i felt is an excellent trait. the team-building exercise helped \nus break the ice and communicate with one another with ease. it introduced rapport and coordination \nbetween the team. one significant learning was that i never felt the necessity to document my research \nand its findings. but i realized that it is very beneficial to follow this process in an organization as my \nteam members or anyone could refer to it for later use.  \noverall, the weekly experience was insightful, motivating, and enthralling.  \nweek 2: (27th february 2023 – 5th march 2023)  \nfrom my past professional it experience, i believe that agile methodology is beneficial for an \norganization that has consistent weekly goals. so, our project manager intern, he arranged a scrum \nmeeting that would happen twice a week (monday and friday), to keep track of our work deliverables \nas well as to provide quick guidance in the hour of need. we also have a presentation session set up at \nthe office every friday, which allows us to present our work and interact with the whole team as well \nas the stakeholders.  \n \n- 14 - \n \n \nafter working together on a group exercise in the first week, the intern team was asked to start working \non their respective stream. as suggested, i started the week with a knowledge transfer session from the \ndeveloper who worked on creating image recognition models and generating image key. the developer \ngranted me access to the code repositories (github) and the virtual coding environment (amazon web \nservices). i was also provided with clear documentation of the work done so far with a detailed \ndescription of various tested modeling approaches and its results. i spent the majority of the week \nunderstanding the existing code and the provided documentation. alongside this, i also immersed \nmyself in some deep-dive research about the new technologies implemented in the line of work and \nsome state-of-the-art techniques used by some competitors.  \nthe week was concluded with quick internal testing for the google form created in the first week. the \nmost common issue reported was the idea of sharing personal information such as passports, driving \nlicense through a google form made people feel insecure. however, the document is shared by your \nnear and dear friends. thus, we ditched the idea unanimously because the user thought it was a breach \nof his/her privacy. we felt that major data acquisition like this should be made through a more secure \ndemo application that was planned to roll out in a couple of weeks. in the meantime, both ceo and \ncoo have asked us to collect the passport samples from the internet and the state or even the countries \nofficial websites to continue working on the goal to acquire this potential client.  \nalthough i knew data acquisition is a challenging task, i never faced a problem with it during the course \nstructure because the datasets are readily provided for us to work with. but it is not the case in real-\ntime, i realized the struggle of collecting the data more importantly, data that has personal information. \ni also got a broader view of privacy concerns people would feel when we request such personal \ninformation. the change of decision to use rough passport samples from the internet and other sources \ndemonstrated that things always would not happen as we planned, and we must improvise according to \nthe situation.  \noverall, the weekly experience was insightful, exciting, and challenging.  \nweek 3: (6th march 2023 – 12th march 2023)  \nthis week was devoted entirely to working on our streams; for me, the week started with researching \nvarious techniques that can be implemented to improve or overcome the limitations of the existing \n(sift) model. the main drawback of the current model was generalizing the sift model for a passport \nafter trying it on the driving licence. the other pressing issue was that unlike drivers licenses, in \npassports, there are not many visual features to match and identify key points. due to this, while running \nthe existing (sift) model, there is a huge jitter in bounding box results. i was focused on solving both \nproblems to obtain an optimal state-of-the-art document detection model.  \nin this first approach, i took 6 different types of classes of passports based on 6 country passport samples. \ni applied sift feature matching and opencv homography to identify the visual features matched \nagainst training images and the testing documents. this showed us that sift recognizes the text as a \nvisual feature and is trying to match the pii data onto the testing documents. hence there is a huge \nnumber of false positive matches in this approach. hence, we considered this approach to be \ninappropriate. \nafter detailed research on the different methodologies and techniques which can be used in the field of \nfor image document classification to produce top-notch results. i created a document detailing my \nunderstanding and findings for a presentation to the team. i received a positive response from the whole \nsquad appreciating the efforts i put into decoding the critical concepts of generalising the object \ndetection model. the team also suggested me to take a more in-depth look at some of the features of \nthat model and validate their claimed accuracies to our business use case.  \n \n- 15 - \n \n \ni also put some effort into collecting some rough sample of different passports of different countries on \nthe internet and uploaded some of the close-matching samples to our confluence page. it could help the \ntemplate generation team to attain a little progress in acquiring all the types of passports from different \ncountries. \nafter reflecting on the whole week, i feel that we always learn and grow from errors or mistakes, we \nhave to respect and appreciate the effort of understanding and accepting the errors or mistakes we put \ninto achieving outstanding results. it also provides a different perspective on solving the problem and \nthe market by considering it from both the consumer and developer viewpoint. overall, the weekly \nexperience was motivating and insightful.  \nweek 4: (13th march 2023 – 19th march 2023)  \nfrom the feedback provided, i kickstarted my week focusing on and researching the features of the \nmodel. although the insights i procured from the documentation are very resourceful, they are still \nlimited in terms of more in-depth technical details that help us decode the ‘x’ factor that contributes to \ntheir commercial success. i was running this task in the background because deciphering the success \nformula of a company that was built on years of research did not seem like a straight-weekly task. when \ndiscussed, both the ceo and coo agreed to this point and asked me to break down the end goal into \nsmaller targets to progressively move forward.  \nas a part of the due diligence process, we need to have an input dataset in a specific format for the \nmodel. however, we used an open-source tool to do the annotation for the image dataset and covert the \ndataset into a specific format according to the model requirements, which can be further extended for \ndriver licenses, passports, and other types of the document and update the model weights accordingly \nas well as adding the classes. alongside, i documented the approach detailing the steps on why and how \nto use the open-source tool and uploaded the python script to convert the annotated image dataset into \nthe required format.  \nbut as a data science student, i feel that verbal feedback cannot be considered as a reflection of actual \nresults, and we need numerical data that comprises far (false acceptance rate) and frr (false \nrejection rate) values to provide a statistical conclusion. so, i started conceptualizing some ways to \nvalidate our model’s claimed accuracies based on the training and validation dataset.  \ni always felt that the primary way to decode an issue lies in trying and implementing various solutions, \nbut over time i learned that academic research is significant. a lot of researchers have spent a lot of \ntime proposing deep-rooted theoretical concepts that can be used to solve many complex problems. \ni also realized that it is beneficial to break down an end goal into smaller targets to help reduce mental \nstress and to provide a clear vision to progress towards the end goal slowly.  \non the whole, the weekly experience was exciting, challenging, and a tad worrying.  \n \nweek 5: (20th march 2023 – 26th march 2023)  \nafter a refreshing break on the weekend, i was recharged and continued the quest of object detection \nmodel. however, i started annotating the image documents based on the data we had as of now from \ndifferent countries. image annotation is the practice of labelling the images to train and ai and machine \nlearning models. basically, it is the process of assigning relevant classes to different entities with an \nimage and the resulting output which will be structed data can be processed through the model. \n \n- 16 - \n \n \nfurther, after the annotation part is done and the output is converted into the desired output for model \ntraining. i started preparing a python script that automates the process of achieving the object detection. \nhowever, to achieve the model that should automatically detect the id documents, classify them with \nhigh confidence score, and segment the shape of the document., pytorch based models can be deployed, \nwhich are easy to setup in aws sagemaker environment for training. apart from that i personally made \nsure that we have installed all the required libraries. \nwhen i presented the idea to the team, the ceo and coo felt this is an innovative approach to \ngeneralise the model that matches our business use case and appreciated my effort in creating a quirky \nsolution to our problem. after making the python script, the management has asked me to devise a test \nstrategy that helps us get a clear view of their claimed accuracies and aid us in deciding the most \naccurate and the best user experience (ux design). i have reached out to the other team members asking \ntheir opinions on what their choice for the user interface and user experience would be.  \ni realized the importance of taking a break because the weekend break has freed me from stress and \nhelped me relax my mind. a fresh start to a new week has made me think from a different perspective \nand helped me solve the problem. overall, the weekly experience was rewarding, motivating, and \ninsightful.  \n \nweek 6: (27th march 2023 – 2nd april 2023)  \nthe preliminary plan for this week was to test our model using the prepared data. but before using the \ndataset, i wanted to have a look at the metadata specifics of the dataset to avoid any bias in the results \nobtained, as it always good to train the model on the balanced dataset to avoid overfitting. i created a \ndocument detailing some visualizations and insights into the data for a quick demonstration to the team.  \ni do not have any idea on how to perform api testing. i started researching the internet and consulted \nthe testing team to find any leads on api testing. i came across many open-source applications that \nperform api testing. although the interface is relatively simple to use, there is no option to automate \nthe requests. so, i decided to prepare a python script that automates these api requests. after some \niterations, i was finally successful in creating the script.  \nafter testing the data for all the devised approaches, i have documented the results and provided \ninferences detailing the pros and cons of each method and concluded which is the best approach in \nterms of ux design. the leaders were pleased with the results of the api testing. but they felt that it’s \nto early to comment on the accuracies of the model as the model was trained on a small prepared dataset \nand does not cover all the constraints. \nduring my presentations, i realized that some of the audiences were not invested when i was providing \ntoo much text information. still, they were very active during the visualization part of the document. i \nhave learned that we have to know our audience before we present something, and visualization is more \nengaging than text information. overall, the weekly experience was very positive and enthralling.  \n \nweek 7: (3rd april 2023 – 9th april 2023)  \n \nthis week the main focus was to concentrate on the improvement of the model by training the model \nwith larger dataset and a greater number of iterations with condition of early stopping to prevent the \noverfitting and to do this we have to go through the process again of annotating the images with \ndescriptive labels and then converting the output of those labels into the desired format for model \ntraining.  \n \n \n- 17 - \n \n \nthis time model performed really well but we still had to make sure it is performing well on the unseen \nimages. therefore, we took 400 unseen images to see and check how exactly the model is responding. \nafter passing the unseen set of data images through the best-trained model, we got the inference output \nimages. further, after that, we passed those sets of predicted images to the python script which \nperformed masking based on the predicted labels for those images. and, based on those masked images \nwe took out the perspective transformed by further passing through the set of python scripts to get the \nperspective transformed image from the segmented image. \nfor the upcoming weeks we will be evaluating the perspective transformed output images and further \nbased on the inspection of those image we will be generalizing and improving the code based on the \nproperties of an image, considering different input images from the users and clients. however, \noverall, the weekly experience was very positive and insightful.  \nmid term break (10th april 2023 – 23rd april 2023)  \nwe had our two-week university midterm break during this period, but i was working and was staying \nup to date with all the work-related deliverables and documenting them. \nas i do not have any inputs on the current study load in terms of assignments and lectures to catch up \nwith. therefore, based on the feedback received from the intern group the management has advised us \nto utilize to catch up with all the work-related deliverables.  \nweek 8: (24th april 2023 – 30th april 2023)  \nafter a refreshing midterm break, i was recharged and geared up to start university again along with \nmy ongoing internship. but a lot has changed from the last week, the work deliverables i had during \nthe seventh week and mid-term break have taken a toss due to certain events on the management side. \nas the perspective transformation does not seem to be in contention anymore because of the bad results.  \nthe week started intensively where i was included in a meeting with the higher management, the agenda \nof the meeting is to find a new solution for perspective transformation till we get our solution up and \nrunning. the management has asked for my inputs on the possible solutions we should look for and \nthey asked me to come up with a list of methods we can work on by considering the possible solutions.  \ni have done some extensive research on various solutions available those are satisfying the qualification \ncriteria. i had to look at the architecture of the solution they are offering, technologies they are using in \nthe backend, verify the accuracies they are claiming, and the user-friendliness in terms of usage. to my \nsurprise, the list is not too long which led me to believe there is a dire need for an object document \ndetection service in the market.  \ni have narrowed down the list of potential solutions and handed them over to the management for further \nsteps. the management appreciated the quick and thorough research and the markers i used in selecting \nthe potential solutions.  \nduring the process of reviewing the solutions, i realized that commercial review is as important as the \nacademic literature review. it gives us a clear idea of the current trends, the industry standards at the \nmoment, and the areas of improvement that could swing the customer base to our products.  \noverall, the weekly experience was very positive and insightful.  \n \n- 18 - \n \n \nweek 9: (1st may 2023 – 7th may 2023)  \nthis week started with no work assigned to me in particular as the management is still in talks with \nsome of the about the possible solutions so, i proposed to the management that i would like to utilize \nthis time in continuing the annotated other type of documents that can be used further for our object \ndetection model. the management said that it was a good initiative from my end and asked me to go \nahead.  \ni have referred back to the technical documents that we documented in week 5 to refresh my memory. \nafter all this detailed academic review, i feel to have connected the missing pieces and i started with \nannotating the different documents based on the data we had as of now from different countries. after, \nannotating the image documents i passed those annotated labels from the python script which was made \nto convert the annotated data into the desired input which is required for model training.  \ni have documented all my learnings and prepared a functional flow chart that was my working approach. \nafter a review from my mentor, i presented these findings to the management. the management was \nvery happy with the efforts and the results. they asked me to continue working on this so that i could \nrefine the assumed approach and be more confident that adopting this approach would give us the results \nwe are hoping for.  \nsimultaneously, i was also doing some extensive research on various solutions available those were \nsatisfying the qualification criteria of perspective transformation for our pipeline desired output. also, \ni learned that perseverance is a key trait when we are working in a field of research and development, \nwe must put enough time into it before we start getting the results. overall, the experience was \nenthralling and rewarding.  \n \nweek 10: (8th may 2023 – 14thmay 2023) \nwith a clear head, i started the week off by creating a road map for the implementation of the object \ndetection model for different types of documents. i divided the work of training, validation, testing and \nevaluating into phases depending on the remainder of the weeks. i presented my roadmap document to \nthe management, and they agreed with the weekly deliverables i proposed.  \nthe first goal in the roadmap is to carry the model by training and validating the model for different \ntype of documents. further, i continued my extensive research for the segmentation and perspective \ntransformation of the documents. the literature review was not so exhausting because of the resources \ngathered last week. with all the resources readily available i continued my literature review and \nacquired some critical understanding of the functioning of methods which our model can adapt and can \nbe useful for our business objective.  \nthe next key aspect of the weekly deliverable would be to create a successful implementation of method \nwhich can help in extracting the segmented and perspective transformed documents from the predicted \noutput. i also found some resources on the implementations of these methods and various types of \nfeatures of those method that were available and can be utilized in various scenarios. i decided to \nimplement a baseline version of that method for starters on our predicted model outputs and then will \nevaluate the output of these methods. further, we can improve its ability and performance depending \non the scenario.  \ncreating a roadmap has given a clear direction and made the work a lot easier. i learned that creating a \nroadmap before implementation helps us focus on one task at a time and achieve the end task without \nany hiccups. overall, the weekly experience was positive, motivating, and rewarding.  \n \n- 19 - \n \n \nweek 11: (15th may 2023 – 21st may 2023) \nthis week has started with a meeting between the research & development team and the management. \nas the internship is scheduled to end in the next couple of weeks the management was focused on \nstructuring the research aspects. the main agenda of the meeting was to bring a clear structure to the \namount of research work we have done so far in our respective streams. we had a session detailing the \nbeneficial aspects of having a document detailing all the research work, on both personal and \norganizational levels.  \naccording to the roadmap, i was supposed to work on the user-specific models. but after the meeting, \ni had to shift my attention towards creating a document detailing all the research work i have done so \nfar in the field of object detection model. the management has given us a rough template on how the \ndocumentation should be framed. the document should constitute the following components such as \nproblem statement, literature review, identified technical knowledge gaps, foreseeable technical \nunknowns, hypothesis for experimentation, experiments & observations, a summary of iterations, \nconclusion, and future work.  \nit was difficult and stressful to recall all the work i had completed in the earlier weeks, but thanks to \nthe weekly reflective journals in the midterm report all the work i have done so far was readily available \nand structurally framed. i tailed back to every piece of the documentation i have created in the earlier \nweeks and started framing the document by summarizing the earlier documentation.  \ni realized the importance of having a structure and keeping track of the work done so far. it helps us to \nrevisit our planned approach at any point in time. it also helps the organization's successors to \nunderstand the work we have already completed and continue from where we left off. i also learned \nthat it is never late to implement a good trait. overall, the weekly experience was resourceful and \nmotivating.  \n \nweek 12: (22nd may 2023 – 28th may 2023) \nthis week has started by presenting the prepared documentations. the management has spent a \nconsiderable amount of time reviewing each documentation in detail to make sure there were no gaps \nor errors. the management was really pleased with the amount of progress we have made in terms of \nwork completed and the detail in which the document was prepared.  \nthe management has provided some tips on how to make the documentation concise and to the point \nrather than wordy. our ceo suggested a mece (mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive) \norganised issue tree as an alternative to providing elaborative content for each component. this issue \ntree can conceptually depict the entire task from the problem statement to the solution proposed. \nwith the inputs from our ceo, i have created a mece structured issue tree for my problem statement \nand presented it to him for a second review. after his approval, i have reframed my documentation \naccordingly and updated it to the confluence portal for the organizational view.  \ni learned a new project managerial technique to represent a problem and the steps required to solve the \nproblem. this could be useful in any domain going forward. overall, the weekly experience was \ninsightful and promising.  \n \n- 20 - \n \n \n \nweek 13: (29th may 2023 – 4th june 2023) \nthis being the last week of the internship, the management has conducted a review session for the \nwhole internship team. they have discussed our feedback in detail and suggested some areas of \nimprovement to be an industry-ready data scientist.  \nhowever, during this whole internship, i learned and gained following knowledge and skillsets: \n• \ndata collection and integration of different types of documents and maintaining the \ndatabase.  \n• \nhow image detection process will be implemented.  \n• \ncreating dynamic pages and documenting my ideas over it and sharing them with \nother colleagues so that everyone can capture and collaborate on the ideas as well as \nthe project. \n• \nprepared the collected data, however, after that segregated image documents based on \ntype and then performed image annotation on the images using tools to create label \ncorresponding to each image.  \n• \ncreating the instance on amazon web services (aws) sagemaker which has the \nenvironment with all the requirements and required libraries needs to install in order \nto train the model. \n• \npreparing model and training model for image dataset using python scripting. \n• \ndocumenting our daily progress on the confluence. \n• \ncollaborating with cross-functional teams, including data engineers, data scientists, \nand software engineers, to ensure the successful deployment and operation of the \nmodel.  \nskills \n• \nanalytical and critical thinking  \n• \nproblem solving  \n• \nteamwork \n• \ndecision-making \n• \ncommunication and interpersonal skills \nlater in the week, the management team asked me to phrase the future work of this project model. \nhowever, throughout this whole journey of learning new thing i was very elated by the belief in me \nand was motivated after having hands on experience of what i have learned in the last two years of \nmy master’s degree and how emotional intelligence plays a very big roll when you are working in a \nteam in an organization. overall, the weekly experience was insightful and rewarding.  \n \n \n \n \n",
