conduct a security consultation meeting with a client \nand apply security controls for their organization. \n \nweek 11 \ngoals, activities and outcomes \nthe goal set forth for me this week was to conduct a security consultation meeting with a client \nto find out their security gaps. additionally, i was asked to go along to clients’ sites in order to \nperform disaster recovery tests on a client organization’s website and database servers, and \nalso to perform a security audit on a school’s it systems.  \nfor my activities this week, i went to the client’s site and directed them on how to perform \ndisaster recovery for their web servers and database servers running on aws. this was done by \nturning off their primary servers to see if the backup servers picked up the traffic load from the \nprimary and vice versa. this was then documented and a report was presented to the client. \nfor the audit, i went to the school along with work colleagues and asked questions to their \nhead of it, head of recruitment and head of finance to find out their security gaps and asked \nfor evidence for every control they claimed to have in place. we then had a tour of their \nprimary server, backup server and dr sites to check gaps in their physical security. finally, we \ncreated a report on our findings where we suggested improvements to their security. \nthe outcome achieved was that a security audit of a school was performed and a draft for the \nreport to improve their security stance was created. disaster recovery tests were also \nperformed for a client organization. \nnew knowledge, skills and experience \ncomp8851 \ninternship final report \n3rd june 2022 \n26 \n \nduring this week, i gained insights on how to perform security audits and how to perform

gaps in their security by the means of investigation. \ndifficult experience \nthe most difficult experience for me during this week was trying to find out gaps in cyber \nsecurity from conversations with people who has little to no idea or awareness about it. \ntasks for the upcoming week \nin the upcoming week, my goals were to perform a security audit of office 365 and firewall \ncontrols for a client organization. i was also asked to tie off all of the open projects assigned to \nme within the upcoming week before ending my internship.  \n \nweek 12 \ngoals, activities and outcomes \nduring this week, i needed to follow up with the client for evidence of their security controls in \norder to continue writing the report for the audit that was performed last week. i also had to \nperform office 365 security controls audit for a client organization. as an additional task, i was \nasked to help with performing an incident response for an organization that had fallen victim to \nphishing email. \ni reached out to the client for whom we performed the security audit and got back evidence \nregarding their security controls and edited the audit report accordingly. the phishing email \nvictim client reached out to us for help regarding the incident and we went through their office \n365 security controls and hardened them by adding log retentions, ediscovery, blocking all \nauto-forwarding and enforcing 2fa for all their accounts. then we went over all the suspicious \nemails that may have caused the phishing to occur and all of the logs that office 365 had \nretained automatically (which were insufficient). we found out the phishing email chain but we \nwere still looking into how exactly they gained access to the credentials of the employee. i also \nperformed a security audit for office 365 controls for another client organization and found out \ntheir security gaps and noted them down to present to the client. \ncomp8851 \ninternship final report \n3rd june 2022 \n27 \n \nthe outcomes from this week were performing an incident response to harden security \ncontrols for office 365; performing security controls audit, and finding out the gaps in security \nfor another client. i also furthered the report for the security audit performed last week. the \noverall outcome was tying off all tasks and projects assigned to me due to this being the last \nweek of my internship at vertex cyber security.  \nnew knowledge, skills and experience \nduring this week, i gained insights on how to perform time-sensitive incident response. \ni gained skills to investigate phishing attacks and to perform time-sensitive security hardening.  \nthe new experience of this week was performing incident response for a phishing victim. \nrewarding experience \ni found the real-world experience of performing time-sensitive incident response in order to \nsecure an organization from further attacks to be very rewarding.  \ndifficult experience \nthe most difficult experience for me during this week was trying to find the point of phishing \nattack from logs and suspicious emails. \ntasks for the upcoming week \nthis being the final week for my internship, i did not have any tasks lined up for the upcoming \nweek. \n \n",
