platform that enables startups to pitch and receive \nautomatic feedback on the pitch. there is an existing trained model that needs to enhanced, \nin addition to adding new features. this project entails data & machine learning, nlp and use \nof microsoft azure and aws microservices, including nodejs and typescript. mainly, giving \nfeedback for the given pitches which helps in deciding the better approach for the pitch given. \nthe initial week was quite good that started with meeting in zoom with the ceo callum bir \nabout the project. he was so cool and interacted very well, initially meeting started with the \nintroduction of ourselves and then going deep detailing of the project and further steps need \nto be taken. he also explained about our responsibilities as intern in the company and how \ncan we implement the things and learn as we go. \nthe outcome from my initial week , completing the project plan using gant charts, and \nresearching required things for the project from resources available. \nnew knowledge, skills and experience: \nin initial week, i have gained knowledge of industry projects like how they work , how they \ninitial steps will be taken to kick start the project. while creating the plan, got knowledge how \nto schedule the deadlines, deliverables, etc. skills how we plan the projects using appropriate \ncharts. \nrewarding experience: \ni felt rewarded when i created the project plan for the project which helps me to present my \nproject presentation skills which includes how to create, time to time delivery of product and \ntheir updates. and also how to divide the time for each task that need to be completed at \ncertain time limit. \ndifficulty experience: \nwhen we had a first meeting , it went so long and it was quite good but at initial point felt \nnervous when meeting with the company officials. as meeting the team members and \nknowing each other initially would be difficult as everyone wont be feeling the same as we \nfeel. but as the program goes we all doing good together. \n \n \nfinal report \ncomp8851 \nindustry based internship \n03 june 2022 \n \n13 \n \n \n \n \ntask for the upcoming week: \nmeeting with the technical  lead manny and discussing about the project plan and gathering \nrequired information for the project. implementing the project plan and searching the \nrequired resources to complete the project. \n \n \n \n11.2 week 2 \ngoals, activities and outcomes: \nfirst meeting with the technical lead manny and introducing ourselves and knowing him \nabout the technical background. he was good and very good listener. before starting into the \nproject he assigned a task to create an notepad application with search feature included in it. \nhe also initiated that we can use any programming language like python, java to create the \napplication. we also started using jira software , it is a software application where every tech \ncompany will be using to track their project progress, and employee task progress and project \nupdates. \nbefore we start developing the application , we need to do a lot research about how we do \napplication development. we found different ways to do it, but we initiated doing it with \npython programming language. we started just creating the application using python and \nadded features like uploading a file , search option to get required search words and their \nposition. we are quite impressed and felt boosted by looking into the result. after creating \nthe required application,, we need to explain the entire process of building the application \nthrough video using loom application. \nfor this week, we created an notepad application with upload and word search feature and \nexplained the entire process by creating a video of it. getting use jira software and their \nterminologies like sprints, scrum meetings. \nnew knowledge, skills, experience: \nas from the data science background, it was an good experience in creating an application \nusing python programming language. get knowledge about how to build an application and \nhow we add features to it like search options was quite interesting. skills like presentation \nskills where we make a video presentation of the process , python programming, jira software \nfor project tracking. \n \nfinal report \ncomp8851 \nindustry based internship \n03 june 2022 \n \n14 \nrewarding experience: \nwhile implementing the process for application development and getting required results \nfeels more rewarding as we are from data background . when we get search results with the \nword position was so impressive for ourselves. getting use to jira software quickly and doing \nrequired things in it was quite interesting and rewarding for us. \ndifficulty experience: \nas creating an application was new to us, it was quite difficult to understand the acquired \nresources and implementing them to get required results. while adding search feature , \nfinding word was easy but getting the position of the word was so hard to find. getting use \nto new environment like using jira software, and also using slack for team member \ninteractions about the project or general queries regarding the project or within the company. \n \ntask for upcoming week: \n getting feedback for the application from the technical lead manny. \ngot a new proposal from our ceo callum bir to change the project from ai pitch to cv \nwriter, have to decide on it. \nneed to kickstart the new project, and creating new plan for the project and getting inputs \nabout the project. \nstarting with daily scrum meetings with the team about the project. \n \n11.3 week 3 \n \ngoals, activities and outcomes: \nintiated the week with meeting with callum about the new project and getting layout for the \nproject. later, we created a project plan and proposal using charts and time schedule. \nthe project mainly deals with the natural language processing that deals with text data. \n \nfirst, we need to collect data from the job posting websites like seek, for different roles like \nbusiness analyst, data analyst, data engineer. we need to collect specific data which has some \ncriteria like only contract jobs whose pay rate has to be more than certain limit per day. \n \nthe outcome was so good that we collected a good amount of data from postings. we got all \nroles that we are looking for by satisfying the required criteria for the input. \n \nnew knowledge, skills, experience: \nfirst , gained knowledge about the realtime data collection which is very interesting and good \nthing to learn. we did a lot of search for different posting available to meet our requirements. \nwe need to be very careful at this step as bad data lead to rewardless outputs. \n \n \nfinal report \ncomp8851 \nindustry based internship \n03 june 2022 \n \n15 \n \n \n \n \nrewarding experience: \ni felt very good when we are able to collect data in realtime and adding them to our data, \nwhich is very satisfying. a good appreciation from our ceo callum bir for data collection. \n \ndifficulty experience: \nas a intern it would be very new and tough job to collect data in realtime , where their will be \nmany requirements to be satisfied. as per requirements we need certain things , but those \nwill be missing in the posting where we loose a part of the data. \n \ntask for upcoming week: \npresenting the data to our supervisor and getting feedback about the data. and also letting \nus know whether we need more features to be added for further improvement of data. \ndiving into natural language processing for cleaning the acquired text data using appropriate \nlibraries. \n \n11.4 week 4 \ngoals, activities and outcomes: \nintitally presenting the realtime collected data to supervisor and getting feedback about the \ndata. getting more inputs for the projects and knowing if any features need to be added to \nthe data. then, need to start cleaning the data as it is raw data, their will be more missing and \nunnecessary data in our proper data. getting use to agile e environment using jira board, \nscrum meetings, sprint meetings, retrospective meetings at last day of the week. \n \nafter collecting data, using python programming language we started cleaning data using \njupyter notebook as a platform to code. first we started removing stop words which are used \nusing libraries available. we need to apply lemamtization of words which helps in repeating \nof words or making the word appropriate. one of the feature need to remove symbols in it \nand we can do using replace method or regex operations to perform it.  \n \nfinally the outcomes was good for the week by removing stopwords in the whole text and \nlemmatized the words. and going through each input of the data to see the results are better \nor not . \n \nnew knowledge, skills, experience: \nearned knowledge about how to use jira board , getting use to agile environment , scrum \nmeetings and python programming for cleaning text data. using python available libraries to \nremove stopwords and lemmatize it ,which improved my skills much better. \n \nfinal report \ncomp8851 \nindustry based internship \n03 june 2022 \n \n16 \ngained knowledge about the natural language processing and implementing them practically \nto our text data. \n \nrewarding experience: \nwhen we created the jira board for project progress we felt much better that getting use to \nreal time environment. and when we started using the technical terms like scrum , sprint felt \nrewarding ourselves with knowledge. when we are getting results for the cleaning data , it \nwas so good and realized how good working in realtime . \n \ndifficulty experience: \nwhen first started creating the jira board we felt difficult as it was first time we are doing it \nand did some minor mistakes which is neligable. when removing stopwords using predefined \nlibraries , as it has only limited stopwords but we need more words that need to be removed \n. at that point it was difficult to find other way of approach. \n \ntask for upcoming week: \n \nas per the project guidelines , we need to extract certain required skills from the data, \nrespective to the roles. to extract skills we have to search for different available algorithms \nthat help in extracting the extract key phrases. \nand after extracting need to check whether the data need more cleaning or more inputs for \nappropriate results. \n \n11.5 week 5 \n \ngoals, activities and outcomes: \ninitially, need to check the clean data whether do we need more cleaning or can go with it. \nnext, as per the project guidelines need to extract the key phrases, and skills from the cleaned \ntext data. research how to extract key phrases using different algorithms available. \ncomparing the results of different algorithms manually and choosing the best algorithm and \nusing it to extract key phrases and extracting the skills from it. \n \ndoing a lot of research on how to apply different algorithms and how the algorithm will work \non the data when we use it . first started with using rake algorithm which gives some good \nresults. then using yake , text rank, key bert algorithms where results were good but felt \nbetter for rake. checking the outputs manually that it extracted the require d results or not \nand verifying it. \n \nthe outcome was so good that we got our key phrases for all the algorithms we used and \nfound the best algorithm that gives the better result. checked the results manually for \nextracted key phrases. updating the work in jira board as project progresses. \n \nnew knowledge, skills, experience: \n \nfinal report \ncomp8851 \nindustry based internship \n03 june 2022 \n \n17 \ngaining knowledge about natural language processing algorithms that helps in extracting key \nphrases where we can use that in many ways. applying those algorithms to the data which \nhelps in improving technical implementation skills. gained knowledge that different \nalgorithms works differently for the same type of extraction rather than giving similar output. \npython programming skills for key phrases extraction and using different algorithms. \n \n \nrewarding experience: \ngaining knowledge about different algorithms for just extraction of key phrases felt \nrewarded. when output of all different algorithms been understand and able to choose the \nbest algorithm from it felt rewarded. when finding some modifications in the results felt \nrewarding. \n \ndifficulty experience: \nas trying to extract key phrases , we research a lot to find the good algorithms and finding it \nis the most difficult part of it. and applying couple of algorithms and getting the required \nresults and choosing the better result from it is hard. checking the results manually to make \nthe results more accurate felt difficult. \n \ntask for upcoming week: \n \nas key phrases has been extracted, few phrases are extracted which are unnecessary in the \nresults. to stop those words , we need to create a list of our important words. \n \nneed to have a meeting with ceo for project updates and further progress of the project. \nand feedback for our previous work. \n \nneed to focus more on accurate skill extraction using our custom important words. \n \n11.6 week 6  \ngoals, activities and outcomes: \ninitially presenting the extracted key phrases results to the supervisor and getting feedback \nabout the results obtained. need to know if any updates has to be done or new features need \nto be added to make more precise outputs. later , having a meeting with our ceo callum for \nfurther progress of the project and inputs for good progress. creating custom important \nwords to make our results of key phrases more accurate to get required skills. we want to \ncheck the results of key phrases before and after cleaning the data for the same algorithm \nand see the performance results and compare them. \n \nstarted with finding most important words and least important words in the extracted \nphrases and making them a list seperately. and using those words to get our accurate \nrequired skills by eleminating the least important words. just out of curiosity , we did all the \nsteps before cleaning data and extracted the key phrases and compare that with clean data \nextracted key phrases. \n \nfinal report \ncomp8851 \nindustry based internship \n03 june 2022 \n \n18 \n \nwe also tried to remove adjectives which doesn't make any sense in the data. \n \nthe outcome looks almost perfect and according to our requirement . as skills has been \nextracted correctly after including the custom important words and least important words . \nthis pattern makes us easy to get required results. \n \n \n \n new knowledge, skills, experience: \nstarted learning how to pick the important words for extarcting skills. comparison of before \nand after cleaning results , get experience of how result changes with perfect data. using our \ncustom words make our skills better , like we have implementee in our way which helps in \nbetter understanding of the problem we have. have used many libraries like textblob, nltk, \nrake and many . \n \nwe started using google colab for coding instead of jupyter notebook where we won't be \nable to loose any part of the code. it is very easy to use as jupyter notebook only. \n \nrewarding experience: \nas we are getting better results we felt very interesting about the project and feeling \nrewarding more knowledge for ourselves. \ngot appreciation for the work done from the callumbir out mentor, ceo and motivated us to \nget more better insights from the data and showing the path to reach the goal. \n \ndifficulty experience: \n \nas we are trying to remove adjectives from the text , we experienced difficulties that our few \nof the important words are ajectives . we don't want to loose them , otherwise the whole \ndata results will change and lead to the wrong patterns . \n \n \ntask for upcoming week: \n \nin the coming week , we need to analyze the rate with the years of experience , to know how \nthe rate varies with experience.  \nwe need to train our skills extracted to gtp3 to generate short form or long sentences by \ngiving some inputs. \ndigging more into openai , how it is useful and how it gonna work and how we are going to \nuse it. \n \n \n \n \nfinal report \ncomp8851 \nindustry based internship \n03 june 2022 \n \n19 \n11.7 week 7 \n \ngoals, activities and outcomes: \nintitally, started the week with delivering acquired results i.e our extracted skills using our \nimportant words and stopping our least important words. we need to have a meeting with \nour mentor callum bir to give feedback on our results. we need to analyse the few features \nlike rate, and years of experience to find the correlation between them. diving into openai , \nand using gtp3 to train our extracted skills and which helps to generate long form sentences. \n \nafter the meeting with our mentor callum bir, we got few more inputs how to go further with \nthe project and what need to be done to analyse the data for required output. he also added \nto go through the openai platform to get use to it and try to generate random long forms \nusing gtp3.  \n \nthe outcome was quite good, extracted years from the requirement and started using openai \nplatform and gtp3 to get knowledge of it . \n \n \nnew knowledge, skills, experience: \nas we are using python programming language, gained knowledge how can we analyse data \nand how to plot charts using available libraries. gained knowledge about the openai platform \nand gtp3 which will be very helpful in further weeks to generate our required results . \n \nrewarding experience: \nwhen we extracted years only from data to do analysis and find some correlation , felt much \nbetter from it. when learning about openai and gtp3 , hope we gained valuable knowledge \nfrom it. \n \ndifficulty experience: \n \nas we extracted years to analyse with rate, but we got few columns with years , we are not \nable to get correct plot. as it is intital stage of openai platform, learning things and getting \nthings done felt a bit difficulty. \n \n \ntask for upcoming week: \n \n \nlearning deeper about the openai and gtp3 platforms. how can we use it to implement in our \nproject . \ntraining our skills data to gtp3 which helps in generating long forms . \nscrum
