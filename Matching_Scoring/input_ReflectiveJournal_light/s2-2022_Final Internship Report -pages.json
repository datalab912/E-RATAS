hands on experience there. this week i have also learnt \nhow we must introduce ourselves and interacted with everyone in the meeting. \nnew knowledge, skills, and experience  \ni was able to gain knowledge and overcome my fear to talk in front of everyone which is the first \nstep of overcoming the fear. i have gained some communication skills. some of the experiences were \nhow to talk to superiors.  \nrewarding experience \nthe staff were very friendly and very informative. communicating with them has solved many \nproblems how this internship runs through the 13 weeks. it was very helpful and honor to know itic \npeople.  \ndifficult experience \n some of the staff were bit fast i was unable to cope up with them at the same time.  \ntask for upcoming week \nwe want to start off with ccirm training which includes domains.  \n \nweek 2 \ngoals, activities and outcomes \nthe goals where we need to complete the domains like overview of the incident response life cycle \nand understanding the threat landscape. we have done activities like quizzes which gives a thorough \nunderstanding of the domains. i've done my research and am aware that there are 10 measures to \nfollow to lessen the effect of cyber events as well as a 7-step procedure for remediating cyber \nproblems as part of the incident response lifecycle. in-depth explanations of aspects of targeted  \ninternship final report \n16 \n \n \n \nassaults such online extremism and hacktivism—which are a part of cyberwarfare and online \nstalking—were provided. the usage of privacy and data protection

how incident response life cycle works \nand its phases. nation and non-nations state actors, challenges faced by cybercrime investigators. \nthe skills i have gained like basic analysis of an attack. i have gained experience threat landscape and \nattack life cycle.  \nrewarding experience \ni felt the topics covered this week was not so tricky it covered all the parts of topic and get to know \nhow to categorize the phases of incident response life cycle and got to know some laws that being \nused in the current world. \n difficult experience \n the felt difficult for logging into the lms portal as there were lot of invalid attempts that was very \ndifficult manage though the supervisor was giving immediate responses it was difficult. \n task for upcoming week \n the responsibilities where need to complete all the quizzes and, we need to start preparing for the \ncoming ccirm exam. the coming week we need to start the other domains. \n \n \n \ninternship final report \n17 \n \n \n \nweek 3 \ngoals, activities and outcomes  \nwe have completed the three domains building an effective incident response capability, preparing \nfor incident response investigations, vulnerability assessment and management, and identifying \nnetwork and system baselines. learnt how to build an effective incident response capability y, how \nto prepare to incident response investigations and how to do vulnerability assessment based on \nawareness and risk background to understand threats and react appropriately. i have also learnt \nsome of the topics like internal and external communication procedures and how building a filed \nforensic system takes place, collecting initial facts, network and incident checklist and malware \ndetails checklists and building an attack timeline. how a vulnerability scanning software works and \nnetwork monitoring evaluation takes place.    \nnew knowledge, skills, and experience i have gained knowledge in incident response plan when an \nattacker attacks the organization. how to identify evaluate and treat vulnerabilities in systems and \nskills gained like basic incident related investigations, performing vulnerability assessment. \n rewarding experience: when listening to the lectures it was quite similar that i have already learnt \nin the cybersecurity management practice. these domains played a good role in this week as there \nwere quite interesting.  \ndifficult experience: the classes were bit lengthy so, it was very difficult to focus on the class and i \nhave also faced some difficulties in doing the quizzes there were quite challenging \ntask for upcoming week \nwe need to start with the rest coming domains simultaneously need to start preparing for the ccirm exam.  \nweek 4 \nthe goal was we need to complete the 4 domains there are indicators of compromise and \nthreat identification, investigative principles and lead development, threat intelligence \ncollection and analysis, and overview of data forensics and analysis. in this week, i have \nlearnt about life cycle of indicator generation, network monitoring, the purpose of \ninvestigations, locard’s principle of exchange and field investigation toolkits. learnt what is \nnetwork and digital forensics and some of the data sources. i have known how to use the \ncases for network monitoring and how to implement event based alert monitoring. what is \nthe purposes of investigations, how document interviews. what is the difference between \ninternship final report \n18 \n \n \nthe network and digital forensics.  \nnew knowledge, skills, and experience \n i have gained knowledge in indicator of compromise and threat identification like how it \nprovides the information which is necessary to identify malicious reconnaissance. what are \ninvestigative tasks and investigative thinking. how data forensics and skills such as analyzing \ninformation to develop investigative plans, information gathering, forensics analysis like \nidentifying, recovering etc.  \nrewarding experience \n overview of data forensics and analysis was quite interesting because it was already in the \nsecurity forensics unit, and it made me to research more on that topic. i was digging deep for \nthat extra information  \ndifficult experience \nindicators of compromise and threat identification was a bit difficult domain. it was a bit \ntricky it was a new topic and, i have never heard about the topics but i’m still learning about \nthat topic.  \ntasks for upcoming week \ntasks for upcoming week: we may proceed for other domains like 11 to 14. we are going to \nfocus on network-based data collection, malware triage followed by quizzes \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninternship final report \n19 \n \n \n \n \nweek 5  \ngoals, activities and outcomes  \nthe goals were needed to complete the four domains called host-based data collections \npractices, network based data collection practices, static and dynamic malware triage, and \nincident containment and remediation. learnt importance of iot devices and live response \nchallenges, learnt some of malware handling concepts and malware triage concepts. \nremediation posturing actions. what is the importance of assessing the malicious sites, \nsandboxes. how live response challenges takes place, data collection and considerations \ntechniques. how to locate endpoint data and use of windows registry. the activities we did \nlike completing the quizzes of the domains.  \nnew knowledge, skills, and experience \n i have gained knowledge in how to collect data and perform analysis that helps to identify \nnetwork vulnerabilities. how to see that malware is present on the system or not. incident \nremediation which helps the organization to limit the amount of damage, and skills such as \ndata collection and analysis. finding malware on the systems.  \nrewarding experience \n domains like static and dynamic malware triage, and network based data collection \npractices are very interesting because learning how the malware takes places and in \nnetworks-based data collection practices there were lot of things that made us explore \nmore on the concepts.  \ndifficult experience \n incident containment and remediation seems to be new for me as i’m very new to the \ntopic.  \ntask for upcoming week  \nwe may proceed for other domains like other 2 domains which finishes the ccirm \ntraining. we are going to focus on incident reporting and creating playbooks and response \nscenarios. \n \n \ninternship final report \n20 \n \n \n \nweek 6  \ngoals, activities and outcomes \nwe have been left with two domains incident reporting and lessons learned and creating \nplaybooks and response scenarios. i have learnt incident reporting and how to write the \nreport and how to document. from this we can document that in future to prevent same \nmistakes. how to build a response playbook. the goals where we need to complete all the \nquizzes of the domains and need to start preparing for ccirm exam.  \nnew knowledge, skills, and experience i have some knowledge in how to build a response \nplaybook and what are the key components of the response playbook. documenting the \nlessons learnt will prevent us from the same mistake for the organization and skills such as \nincident response report writing and how to document the lessons happened in the \norganization and building a response playbook.  \nrewarding experience \nthe experience was that both domains are quite easy as i learnt in the cybersecurity \nmanagement practice.  \ndifficult experience \n the domains are easy, but the terms are bit difficult to understand.  \ntasks for upcoming week \n we may proceed for project ares. we are going to focus on hands on experience and give \npresentations from next week. \n \nweek 7  \ngoals activities and outcomes \nproject ares' battle rooms were introduced this week, and our lecturer provided a practical \ndemonstration and explanation of the duties that must be completed on this platform. every \nweek, a set of tasks must be completed, and the platform tracks our progress in-game. once the \n\"game\" has begun, i was given the player designation, and it directs us to a visual console where \nwe can select different tasks and the knowledge library for those jobs. as a result, battle room 9, \nwhich deals with cyber forensics, was ordered to come first. \n \ninternship final report \n21 \n \n \nthe task that i was given was what is the laptop’s operating system? and briefing what  \n \ntools did i used, and the process how did i go through? \n i have taken the help of some hints which was provided by project ares platform and able \nto do it. the procedure follows as below, by exploring the software registry hive i \nnavigated to microsoft> windows nt > currentversion.  \n \n \n \ni have presented it in allotted class to wade and other fellow mates and also received some \nfeedbacks according to my presentation.  \nrewarding experience \n i learned about the following things throughout the seventh week of my training.  \nexercises based on forensics investigation in battle room 9. to uncover critical information \non steve rogers' laptop, i utilised the autopsy programme. to identify the operating \nsystem and time zone information, i utilised registry hives. \npresentation skills and teamwork abilities were improved. to accomplish the battle room 9 \nmissions, which were based on forensics investigation, you had to think analytically. \ndifficult experience  \ndoing everything online, in my opinion, was the most challenging experience. because of \ncovid19, all our seminars and workshops will be held online, which i find extremely \nchallenging because face-to-face contact encourages more effective learning. while \ninternship final report \n22 \n \n \nperforming forensics investigation on steve laptop, i was met with some difficult \nquestions. i believe the difficult aspect was documenting all the processes and important \nfacts i acquired while researching his laptop. \ntasks for upcoming week  \nthe trainer will discuss more battle room activities and place us in project areas utilizing \nplatform circadence in the next week. in the following weeks, i'll dig further into steve's \nlaptop to see if there's anything else i can learn about it. \n \n  week 8 \ngoals activities and outcomes \nthis week’s tasks are the continuation in battle room 9 which includes what folder were \nthe files located in before they were deleted to the recycle bin? we can find out by \nnavigating to the folder of $recycle.bin. this recycles bin contains an individual folder \nnamed sid of each user. when a file is moved to a recycle bin the file name is replaced by a \n$r and some series of random numbers. there we have another folder that consists of \ndata. choose one of them that start with $i (this file contains the original directory, time of \ndeletion and size of deleted file) then in the bottom pane reveal the path of the $r file.  \n \n \nnew knowledge, skills, and experience  \ninternship final report \n23 \n \n \ni developed my research abilities while looking at the vulnerability problem. my social skills \ngrew when i had a conversation with my friends about the issue. i worked on my presenting \nskills by giving my instructor jeff a weekly presentation on friday. this week, i discovered \nthat any tiny file or folder might contain crucial information while undertaking forensics \ninvestigation. as a result, you must proceed with great caution while looking over \ninformation as a forensic analyst. among other things, i discovered fresh information \nregarding ubs historian, app data, and recycle bin analysis. \nrewarding experience \nwhen i submitted my findings to my instructor, i received favourable comments. \nstudies on vulnerability assessment to him. this increased my confidence and \nimproved my speaking in front of an audience. \ndifficult experience  \nmemorizing so many specifics about the various instruments during week 8 was the most \ndifficult part. i had to become knowledgeable in many different fields and learn how to use \nmany different tools. i had to commit my vulnerability analysis to memory to present it to \nmy instructor. i was finally successful in doing all my responsibilities on time. \n \nweek 9  \nwe need to continue the rest of the tasks of battle room 9 which includes what date did \nsteve visit the website smokecartel.com? website history provides the answer to this query \nsince it logs the website url together with information on when it was viewed, such as the \ndomain and title. by going to the database, you may view the web history for steve rogers \nlaptop e01. search the domain for smokecartel.com. now, search for the access date at the \nbottom of the results pane. the above figures give an idea how it has been done.  \n \ninternship final report \n24 \n \n \n \n \nnew knowledge, skills, and experience  \ni came to know to use these the hidden appdata folder in each user directory stores \nsettings and data for applications and also got to know the appdata subfolders can provide \nan indication of applications used by a user. the main fact that web browsers store data like \nhistory and bookmarks in subfolders of a user's appdata folder. \nrewarding experience \nthis week all the tasks were good as well as challenging, but the instructors were \nthroughout the week to encourage us to the tasks and get hand on experience.  \ndifficult experience \nas some of the tasks were challenging was not able study all the tools but i managed to get \nsome things done by external resource and by project ares hints. \ntasks for upcoming week \nthe tasks for the next coming week would be like completing the rest of the battle room 9 \ntasks and moving into the battle room 11.  \n \n \ninternship final report \n25 \n \n \nweek 10  \n• this week we need to wind up with the all the br9 tasks which includes how many pictures \ncan be from steve’s camera card? when carving modules are run against an image in \nautopsy, deleted files available to be carved are put in the $carvedfiles folder at the root of \nthe volume. the photorec carver module carves files from unallocated space in the data \nsource and sends the files found through the ingest processing chain. \nthis can help a reviewer discover more information about files that used to be on the device \nand were subsequently deleted. by navigating to tool’s menu bar < add data source < \nselecting the run ingest modules < steve rogers camera card. e01. once the module has \nrun, view the $carvedfiles folder under the camera card image using the tree pane on the \nleft.  \n \n \n \nnew skills and experience  \ni have got to know some new things like extracting information from the attackers. what all \ndid he used how, many pictures. the tools that have been used like photo rec carver where \nit carves the files. \nrewarding experience  \ni had a good experience in week 9 since i was able to become proficient in all of the forensic \ntools mentioned above. \ninternship final report \n26 \n \n \ndifficult experience \nremembering important technical terms and passing three tests on three different topics \nwere this week's challenges. i had to read a great deal and do a ton of practice papers to ace \nthe quiz. \ntasks for upcoming week  \nthis week we winded up all the br 9 tasks. we going to start off with the next br11 system \nsecurity analyst tasks.  \n \nweek 11 \ngoals, activities, outcomes \nwe started battle room 11 this week and it is focused on linux command line interface and \npowershell. one of the tasks is about determining active network connections. we were \nrequired to connect to a virtual machine that runs on kali linux by using putty software. \nthis virtual machine was provided internally by the battle room. one of the tasks required \nus to determine connections, interference statistics and routing tables.  \none of the tasks which include from the windows client, obtain a list of all active network \nconnections without resolving names. this can be achieved through the netstat command \ncan be used to look at the status of a network connection without doing name lookups. this \nis useful for identifying which ip and for application is listening to a particular port. the \ncommand netstat –an gives list of all active connections without resolving the names  \n \n \ninternship final report \n27 \n \n \n \nnew skills and experience  \ni was able to learn how we use putty and kali linux and got to know that putty is a network \nfile transfer applications and supports several network protocols like ssh, telnet etc  \nkali linux is used for pen tester and security auditing purposes.  \nrewarding experience  \nthis week all the 15 tasks which was given are very good and seems like generic stuff.  \ni really appreciate the project ares team that they start to prep the students from basics to \ntough stuff.  \ndifficult experience \nthis week wasn't challenging for me. i enjoyed my time at work this week and completed all \nmy tasks on time. \ntasks for upcoming week  \nthe br11 continues with rest of the tasks which needs not be performed  \n \nweek 12  \ngoals, activities, outcomes \nfrom kali linux client, send an icmp request to the machine 192.168.0.118 with a timestamp \nrequest. for this special icmp request you'll need to lore hping to send a timestamp request \nto the target machine. hping was written by michel zalewski and adapted for windows by \nsalvator sanfilippo with the aid of several other authors. it goes further than pink for \ntraditional troubleshooting and evaluation. it allows for tranferring files under supported \nprotocols, handles fragmentation, as well as arbitrary packet sizes. it is sometimes referred \nto as the swiss army knife for packets in that you can create custom crafted packets using \ncommand line switches. on windows and linux, you must run hping as an administrator \n(sudo or run cmd.exe as administrator). without this the application doesn't have enough \npermission to create the custom tcp/ip requests. \nby giving the command sudo hping3 –icmptype 13 192.168.11.118 \nwe use a command called “hping” which allows users to transfer files between systems with \nsupported protocols and also handles fragmentation. \ninternship final report \n28 \n \n \n \n \n \nnew knowledge, skills and experience \ni have got know the hping and netstat commands we use a command called “hping” which \nallows users to transfer files between systems with supported protocols and also handles \nfragmentation. \nrewarding experience: \nthis week’s content increased my understanding of icmp messages and network \ncommunications which include sending messages between different operating systems. \nvarious network protocols were also mentioned in the knowledge hub and types of \ncommands that can be used to modify the properties of sending messages. \ndifficult experience \nit was a bit difficult to manage the things because there was a bit confusion in the protocols \nwhich is used for what. i tried to use external sources for better understanding of the \nprotocols. \ntasks for upcoming week  \nthe tasks would be like we are at the end of the internship so, we are going to wind up the \nbr11 tasks and give presentations.  \n \n \n \n \ninternship final report \n29 \n \n \nweek 13  \nthe tasks that include get a list of all the running processes being run by administrator.  \nlinux keeps track of all the running processes. the command to look at the process table is \nps, but by default, you would only see processes what belong to you. all the other processes \non the system wouldn't be displayed. the ps command supports multiple switches, though \nthey don't require a - like other commands. instead, you would just concatenate all the single \nletter parameters together. if you wanted to use wide output with a session list, you would \nuse ps sw. \nthis can be achieved through the command ps a \n \n  \n \nnew knowledge, skills and experience \nthe skills that i have gained was commands knowledge and got to know what is it is used for \nthe ps command supports multiple switches, though they don't require a - like other \ncommands. \nrewarding experience \nthe task seems to be very challenging though my friends and i have a better understanding \non how to do it. \nhere i got to know hoe teams work be like.  \ndifficult experience \nthere are lot of tasks to be finished by the deadline as we need to wind up the internship, \nwe have all the rest of the tasks to be finished. it was very challenging.  \n",
