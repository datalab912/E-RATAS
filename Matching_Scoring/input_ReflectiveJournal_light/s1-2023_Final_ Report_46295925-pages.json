    "text": "week 1:  \n \ngoal, activities & outcome:  \n \nthe main goal of this week was to get introduction of the project and it’s \nteam members. also be guided by the supervisor about the project and \ndiscussing the responsibilities of it.  \nin the 1st week there was a team meeting arranged by truuth with all of it’s \ninterns and supervisor for introducing the project and responsibilities to it’s \ninterns. give a brief overview of the whole project and the company itself. \nby this week, we needed to submit our internship proposal as well.  \n \nrewarding experience: \n \nget introduced with a new concept using already gained ml project \nexperiences. this week mostly was introductory week for all of the interns, \nso not that much mind blowing experience happened this week.  \nthough till now, i implemented ml models only for project purposes with \nminimalistic collected data set. now here from collection of real life data \nsets, there’s opportunity to implement it with different features in gan \nmodels which is the project target.  \n \nchallenging experience: \n \nthe communication system with the ceo (who was my main supervisor i \nthe 1st place) was a bit difficult though it was not sorted out at that time. i \ngot reply for this internship confirmation reply and agreement after 6 days \nof initial confirmation letter after several calls and emails, and felt a bit bad \nand lagged behind for coping up with the internship project target. though \ni meet the team and supervisor in the meeting in the last minute invited \nmeeting. it was the 1st week and hoped this problem will be less in further \ndays. \n \nsuggestion/ feedback: \n \nimprovement of their communication level \nneed to maintain a proper hierarchy for communication   \n \nupcoming week tasks:  \n \nas week 1 was just an intro of the entire intern team and project \ndescription, each team was needed an individual meeting for proper work \ndistribution and description. also every part of the project is very different \nfrom other. so a proper liveness project meeting was needed.  \nalso project access and truth id was needed. \nthe agreement form for security purposes was needed.  \nneeded to introduce with data collection as per project requirement.  \n \nweek 1 ended on 24th february, 2023 \n \nweek 2: \n \ngoal, activities & outcome: \n \nthe goal this week was complete access of the project, company id. also a \ncomplete overview of the project, target of the overall internship was \nexpected. also visit the office space on friday office hours and work on-site, \nattend weekly meetings from 5-6 on friday.  \n \ngot a meeting with the supervisor on 1st march, 2023 and get the assigned \ntasks of the project. got instructed to go through the already used dataset \nfor liveness project and got a list of that.  \n \ngot an overall concept of my aim of work for this internship project and \nhow i can help, what tools i am going to use for this purpose.  \n \nrewarding experience: \n \ni never had any experience in aws though it is quite popular in the \nindustry. i would be able to work with that for remaining internship time \nwhich is amazing. contacted with ceo and my supervisor, the people here \nare also very friendly. \nso got to know about aws sagemaker and also atlassian confluence page \nfor documentation purposes.  \n \nchallenging experience: \n \nthis time there was less problem for communicating with the team rather \nthan previous time.  \nthe company id could not be accessed during the week and also the \nproject agreement and on-boarding was still pending because of this \nreason.  \nat the end of week, got the company id, and still the project access was \npending.  \n \nsuggestion/ feedback: \n \n need proper organize or management for maintaining the newly arrived \ninterns so that the time can be properly used for project purposes.  \nthe instruction about company rules for new interns should be clear \nenough so that they can be properly instructed and got to know about the \nrules and regulations.  \n \nupcoming week tasks:  \n \n- the data collection for the model with diversity is the target are not \ngiving close to accurate result. \n- project details idea a bit more and broadly for their ml models. \n- the on-boarding at the time of project access \n \nweek 2 ended on 3th march, 2023 \n \n \nweek 3: \n \ngoal, activities & outcome: \n \ndata collection and rnd about publicly available data, get an idea about \nthe dataset that has been provided before for this project purposes. access \nto project and get idea about the data of the project requirement. \n \nthe rnd about the data was done in this week.  \nthe project access couldn’t able to be given by the security team for the \nother project pressure. on the work of doing data augmentation and get \nidea for getting better output of the present model and improving the \ndiversity of the datasets.  \n \nrewarding experience: \n \nlearning about new datasets and different features of the present datasets. \neach of the datasets have their codes and attack areas which is really \nfruitful to get the idea.  \nthe attacks happened in real life project and diversity of data is really \nremarkable here. \n \nchallenging experience: \n \nthe project access didn’t able to get even in the 3rd week of this project \nwork. still stuck with the data augmentation and data collection section.  \nthough the communication was less difficult this time.  \n  \nsuggestion/ feedback: \n \nneed more efficient people in the sector of security access and project \naccess.  \nimprovement of the communication skill with the temporary employee like \ninterns. \nproper follow-up about the interns about the system access and other \nformalities. \nneed proper time set-up and meet up for the internship involved people \n(not only supervisor, but other people related to project access related \nwork) \nit was week 3 still didn’t get the project access of aws which was pretty \nfrustrating. \n \nupcoming week tasks:  \n \nget the project access of aws and started relate to the data sets i had \nlooked through for past 3 weeks.  \nweek 3 ended on 10th march, 2023 \n \nweek 4: \n \ngoal, activities & outcome: \n \nthe goal of this week was getting access to the project; started working and \nunderstanding the models; trying to get better dataset. more rnd about \nthe facial expression models and already implemented models \n \nsuggestion/ feedback: \n \nto improve their communication skill with the interns and more frequent \nabout mailing. more communicative about updates and internal connection \nwithin all other interns for better works.  \n \nupcoming week tasks:  \n \nget the access to the models and data sets of the projects and start \nworking on that directly and try to do better in facial expression cases \n \nweek 4 ended on 17th march, 2023 \n \nweek 5: \n \ngoal, activities & outcome: \n \ncommunicate with the cyber security officer of truth, who is from india and \nneed some more time for communicating him for different time-zone. got \nthe access for confluence page of liveness data page for documentation of \nmy work, get sagemaker access from aws for already implemented models \nstructure for further work.  it took one week for getting full project and \ndifferent other apps access, and to know how to operate them, and what i \nactually need for further progress.  \n \nsuggestion/ feedback: \n \nthe communication if can be done by some other known platform rather \nthan just company’s own app, that will be more better for interns or short \ntime employees. like, whatsapp has been used for solving this project \naccess problem. because for interns, mostly it’s their first job so for getting \nmore communicative and involve him/her more into the project is mostly \nsupervisor’s responsibility.  \n \n \nupcoming week tasks:  \n \nas got the access of the project and confluence page, need to start \ndocumenting the public datasets and models task into it and at first explore \nthe other pages how to document and the projects work here.  \n \nweek 5 ended on 24th march, 2023 \n \nweek 6: \n \ngoal, activities & outcome: \n \ngot the access of the live project fully. data collection of public datasets are \nstill on going. more requirements for public datasets got from the team \nmeeting of the supervisor and the ceo. need to use the datasets for the \nimplemented models. joined the team meeting. the project objective has \nbeen explored. need to attend internship meetings for mid semester \npresentation and need to complete internship report for giving the updates \nof my work with truuth.  \n \nsuggestion/ feedback: \n \nthe communication with the supervisor and the ceo is getting better and \nless difficulties has been faced this week compared to the previous weeks. \nmy suggestion will be, give a proper timeline with proper guidelines of the \nway of communication with the supervisors and the team members. for \nweekly updates and other update if the meeting is not possible, chat should \nbe used most commonly. but timetable for the interns for pushing them \nand encouraged them to involve with the company is really needed. \nsometime the interns maybe shy and introvert.  \n \n \n \n \n \nupcoming week tasks:  \n \nexplore more machine learning models and dataset collection from \ndifferent sectors. add more features for collecting data for the models. the \nfeatures will be given by the supervisor. \n \nweek 6 ended on 31st march, 2023 \n \nweek 7: \n \ngoal, activities & outcome: \n \ngive the update in the team meeting about newly found public dataset and \nlive image links, attend update meeting of liveness project, give \ndocumentation of the work till now and review it in the meeting. getting \nthe updates from the team meeting from the supervisors. got some useful \nnew websites from the public platforms which fulfilled the data \nrequirements of the project.   \ngetting different ideas of fake datasets and define their parameters for \nthis. and every time getting more idea about the variety of datasets from \nexploring them.  \n \nsuggestion/ feedback: \n \nthe experience is getting better by better communication now.  \n \nupcoming week tasks:  \n \nfinal update on data collection if there is more requirements for the need \nof the project or not, check that.  word document file present in the \nmeeting (the work till now); future step discussion for the project. update \nas per the direction from the supervisors about the document. \n \nweek 7 ended on 7th april, 2023 \n \nweek 8: \n \ngoal, activities & outcome: \n \ngive update about the datasets and the research papers and give some \nsummery about them. some of the dataset access request got approved by \nthis week. pass them to the supervisor and get checked. attended the team \nmeeting. get the idea about annotation of the datasets and getting the \nidea about the quality check of those datasets. \n \nsuggestion/ feedback: \n \nthe communication with the supervisor is better now. the update and \nproject organizing quality can be improved and more accurate and stable.  \n \nupcoming week tasks:  \n \nupdate about new data collection and if the more requests are approved, \ngive the update about them. document every work that is being done by \nthe week. getting involved into the annotation work.   \n \nweek 8 ended on 28th april, 2023 \n \nweek 9: \n \ngoal, activities & outcome: \n \nattend meeting about new step of this training, annotation of image data \nsample using certain amount of given labels. get to know about the labels \nand the process of the annotation. giving update about the datasets if got \nany permission of the data access.  \n \n \n \n \nsuggestion/ feedback: \n \nthe communication with the supervisor is better now. the update and \nproject organizing quality can be improved and more accurate and stable.  \n \nupcoming week tasks:  \n \nupdate about new data collection and if the more requests are approved, \ngive the update about them. document every work that is being done by \nthe week. getting involved into the annotation work.  \n  \nweek 9 ended on 5th may, 2023 \n \nweek 10: \n \ngoal, activities & outcome: \n \nfinal update about data collection is done in the meeting, move forward to \ndata annotation and labelling of objects of image. the documentation is \nstill updating. done with 150 image annotation and gave them for review to \ncheck correct labelling. confluence page update with snapshots of the \ndatasets and some research papers updates, for documentation of my \nwork.  \ngetting to know the usage of labelling and annotation for the image \ndatasets.  \n \nsuggestion/ feedback: \n \nthe communication is now normal and update is given and taken properly \nweekly.  \n \nupcoming week tasks:  \n \n- next meeting about next step of some data collection (if required more) \n- data labelling, annotation more brief by supervisor in next meeting \n- update data sets in s3 upload \n- confluence update and getting review \n-  \nweek 10 ended on 12th may, 2023 \n \nweek 11: \n \ngoal, activities & outcome: \n \ngiving update about image labelling and object detection, annotation \nphase from the supervisor. which file we needed for this annotation \npurpose clarify that. join group meeting. \n \nsuggestion/ feedback: \n \nthe communication is now normal and update is given and taken properly \nweekly.  \n \nupcoming week tasks:  \n \n- update meeting about data annotation and labelling \n- documentation about work till then. \n   \nweek 11 ended on 19th may, 2023 \n \nweek 12: \n \ngoal, activities & outcome: \n \ndone with data annotation in respect with the required image labels, \nattend weekly meeting for update, get review about the annotation, final \nupdate in the documentation of the tasks in confluence page, dataset \nupload in s3(aws platform), labelled image submitted and got good \nreview. got to know about using ai tools for annotate image online easily.  \n \nsuggestion/ feedback: \n \nfrom mid to the last half of the internship communication was really good. \nstill need to upgrade their communication way and make it more versatile \nfor new people. make the communication way more stable and not only \nrelying upon teams software.  \n \nupcoming week tasks:  \n \n- final update about all the work till now \n- meeting about review of the entire internship \n \nweek 12 ended on 26th may, 2023 \n \n \n \n",
